  ABSTRACT = {We describe here a development in the system Coq
  of a piece of Finite Automata Theory. The main result is the Kleene's
  theorem, expressing that regular expressions and finite automata
  define the same languages. From a constructive proof of this result,
  we automatically obtain a functional program that compiles any
  regular expression into a finite automata, which constitutes the main
  part of the implementation of {\tt grep}-like programs. This
  functional program is obtained by the automatic method of {\em
  extraction} which removes the logical parts of the proof to keep only
  its informative contents.  Starting with an idea of what we would
  have written in ML, we write the specification and do the proofs in
  such a way that we obtain the expected program, which is therefore
  efficient.},

Generations of readers have relished Polya's deft--indeed, brilliant--instructions on stripping away irrelevancies and going straight to the heart of the problem.<P>}},

abstract="We present a simply-typed $\lambda$-calculus with explicit substitutions and we give a fully formalised proof of its soundness and completeness with respect to Kripke models. We further give conversion rules for the calculus and show also for them that they are sound and complete with respect to extensional equality in the Kripke model. A decision algorithm for conversion is given and proven correct. We use the technique ``normalisation by evaluation'' in order to prove these results. An important aspect of this work is that it is not a formalisation of an existing proof, instead the proof has been done in interaction with the proof system, ALF.",

abstract="We extend Bove's technique for formalising simple general recursive algrithms in constructive type theory to nested recursive algorithms. The method consists in defining an inductive special-purpose accessibility predicate, that characterizes the inputs on which the algorithm terminates. As a result, the type-theoretic version of the algorithm can be defined by structural recursion on the proof that the input values satisfy this predicate. This technique results in definitions in which the computational and logical parts are clearly separated; hence, the type-theoretic version of the algorithm is given by its purely functional content, similarly to the corresponding program in a functional programming language. In the case of nested recursion, the special predicate and the type-theoretic algorithm must be defined simultaneously, because they depend on each other. This kind of definitions is not allowed in ordinary type theory, but it is provided in type theories extended with Dybjer's schema for simultaneous inductive-recursive definitions. The technique applies also to the formalisation of partial functions as proper type-theoretic functions, rather than relations representing their graphs.",

                  computability logic --- the game-semantically
                  conceived formal theory of computational resources
                  and tasks.  This relatively young nonclassical logic
                  is a conservative extension of classical first order
                  logic but is much more expressive than the latter,
                  yielding a wide range of new potential application
                  areas. In a reasonable (even if not strict) sense
                  the same holds for intuitionistic and linear logics,
                  which allows us to say that CoL reconciles and
                  unifies the three traditions of logical thought (and
                  beyond) on the basis of its natural and "universal"
                  game semantics. A comprehensive online survey of the
                  subject can be found at

  abstract	  = {It is well known that the length of a
                  beta-reduction sequence of a simply typed
                  lambda-term of order k can be huge; it is as large
                  as k-fold exponential in the size of the lambda-term
                  in the worst case. We consider the following
                  relevant question about quantitative properties,
                  instead of the worst case: how many simply typed
                  lambda-terms have very long reduction sequences? We
                  provide a partial answer to this question, by
                  showing that asymptotically almost every simply
                  typed lambda-term of order k has a reduction
                  sequence as long as (k-1)-fold exponential in the
                  term size, under the assumption that the arity of
                  functions and the number of variables that may occur
                  in every subterm are bounded above by a constant. To
                  prove it, we have extended the infinite monkey
                  theorem for strings to a parametrized one for
                  regular tree languages, which may be of independent
                  interest. The work has been motivated by
                  quantitative analysis of the complexity of
                  higher-order model checking.},

  abstract	  = {User defined recursive types are a fundamental
                  feature of modern functional programming languages
                  like Haskell, Clean, and the ML family of languages.
                  Properties of programs defined by recursion on the
                  structure of recursive types are generally proved by
                  structural induction on the type. It is well known
                  in the theorem proving community how to generate
                  structural induction principles from data type
                  declarations. These methods deserve to be better
                  know in the functional programming
                  community. Existing functional programming textbooks
                  gloss over this material. And yet, if functional
                  programmers do not know how to write down the
                  structural induction principle for a new type - how
                  are they supposed to reason about it? In this paper
                  we describe an algorithm to generate structural
                  induction principles from data type declarations. We
                  also discuss how these methods are taught in the
                  functional programming course at the University of
                  Wyoming. A Haskell implementation of the algorithm
                  is included in an appendix.},

  abstract	  = {We propose a "modal linear logic" to reformulate
                  intuitionistic modal logic S4 (IS4) in terms of
                  linear logic, establishing an S4-version of Girard
                  translation from IS4 to it. While the Girard
                  translation from intuitionistic logic to linear
                  logic is well-known, its extension to modal logic is
                  non-trivial since a naive combination of the S4
                  modality and the exponential modality causes an
                  undesirable interaction between the two
                  modalities. To solve the problem, we introduce an
                  extension of intuitionistic multiplicative
                  exponential linear logic with a modality combining
                  the S4 modality and the exponential modality, and
                  show that it admits a sound translation from IS4.
                  Through the Curry-Howard correspondence we further
                  obtain a Geometry of Interaction Machine semantics
                  of the modal lambda-calculus by Pfenning and Davies

In this paper, we give sufficient conditions for (local) confluence of closed nominal rewriting theories, based on the analysis of rule overlaps. More precisely, we show that closed nominal rewriting rules where all proper critical pairs are joinable are locally confluent. We also show how to refine the notion of rule overlap to derive confluence of the closed rewriting relation. The conditions that we define are easy to check using a nominal unification algorithm."

  abstract = {We present game semantics of Martin-L\"of type theory
                  (MLTT), which solves a long-standing problem open
                  for more than twenty years. More specifically, we
                  introduce a category with families of a novel
                  variant of games, which induces an interpretation of
                  MLTT equipped with one-, zero-, N-, pi- and
                  sigma-types as well as Id-types or a cumulative
                  hierarchy of universes (n.b., the last two types are
                  incompatible with each other in our semantics), and
                  the interpretation is faithful for the (one, pi,
                  sigma)-fragment. Notably, it generalizes standard
                  game semantics of simple type theories in a natural,
                  canonical way in the sense that the CwF forms a
                  reflective subcategory of the category of
                  conventional games and strategies, and the former
                  inherits the game-semantic and the domain-theoretic
                  structures of the latter. Also, our semantics can be
                  regarded naturally as a mathematical formalization
                  of the standard BHK-interpretation (or the meaning
                  explanation) of MLTT, giving a mathematical,
                  semantic, intensional foundation of constructive
                  mathematics, comparable to the set-theoretic one for
                  classical mathematics. By its conceptual naturality
                  and mathematical precision, the semantics provides
                  useful insights on the syntax as well.},

  abstract	  = {MergeInsertion, also known as the Ford-Johnson
                  algorithm, is a sorting algorithm which, up to
                  today, for many input sizes achieves the best known
                  upper bound on the number of comparisons. Indeed, it
                  gets extremely close to the information-theoretic
                  lower bound. While the worst-case behavior is well
                  understood, only little is known about the average
                  case.  This work takes a closer look at the average
                  case behavior. In particular, we establish an upper
                  bound of $n \log n - 1.4005n + o(n)$ comparisons. We
                  also give an exact description of the probability
                  distribution of the length of the chain a given
                  element is inserted into and use it to approximate
                  the average number of comparisons
                  numerically. Moreover, we compute the exact average
                  number of comparisons for $n$ up to 148.
                  Furthermore, we experimentally explore the impact of
                  different decision trees for binary insertion. To
                  conclude, we conduct experiments showing that a
                  slightly different insertion order leads to a better
                  average case and we compare the algorithm to the
                  recent combination with (1,2)-Insertionsort by Iwama

                  strategy. Different strategies may then be
                  considered, and it is important that they satisfy
                  some abstract rewriting property, such as
                  factorization or normalization theorems.  In this
                  paper we provide simple proof techniques for these
                  theorems. Our starting point is a revisitation of
                  Takahashi's technique to prove factorization for
                  head reduction. Our technique is both simpler and
                  more powerful, as it works in cases where
                  Takahishi's does not. We then pair factorization
                  with two other abstract properties, defining
                  \emph{essential systems}, and show that
                  normalization follows. Concretely, we apply the
                  technique to four case studies, two classic ones,
                  head and the leftmost-outermost reductions, and two
                  less classic ones, non-deterministic weak
                  call-by-value and least-level reductions.},

                  showed how the usual natural deduction inference
                  rules for disjunction, conjunction and absurdity can
                  be derived using those for implication and the
                  second order quantifier in propositional
                  intuitionistic second order logic $NI^2$. It is
                  however well known that the translation does not
                  preserve the relations of identity among derivations
                  induced by the permutative conversions and immediate
                  expansions for the definable connectives, at least
                  when the equational theory of $NI^2$ is assumed to
                  consist only of $\beta$ and $\eta$ equations. On the
                  basis of the categorial interpretation of $NI^2$, we
                  introduce a new class of equations expressing what
                  in categorial terms is a naturality condition
                  satisfied by the transformations interpreting
                  $NI^2$-derivations. We show that the Russell-Prawitz
                  translation does preserve identity of proof with
                  respect to the enriched system by highlighting the
                  fact that naturality corresponds to a generalized
                  permutation principle. We show that these result
                  generalize some facts which have gone so far

                  naturality of natural deduction", Studia Logica
                  2019) we investigate the exact relationship between
                  the Russell-Prawitz translation of intuitionistic
                  propositional logic into intuitionistc second-order
                  propositional logic (System F), and its variant
                  proposed by Fernando Ferreira and Gilda Ferreira
                  into the atomic fragment of System F (System
                  Fat). In the previous paper we investigated the
                  Russell-Prawitz translation via an extended
                  equational theory for System F arising from its
                  categorical semantics. The main result of this paper
                  is that the Russell-Prawitz translation and Ferreira
                  and Ferreira's translation are equivalent modulo
                  this extended equational theory. This result
                  highlights a close connection between our previous

                  original Russell-Prawitz translation with our
                  extended equational theory is more satisfactory for
                  the study of proof identity than the one based on
                  System Fat.},

                  cryptography and especially the difficulties
                  involved in factoring numbers composed of product of
                  two large prime numbers have been put to use in many
                  modern cryptographic designs. Thus, the problem of
                  distinguishing prime numbers from the rest is vital
                  and therefore there is a need to have efficient
                  primality testing algorithms.  Although there had
                  been many probabilistic algorithms for primality
                  testing, there wasn't a deterministic polynomial
                  time algorithm until 2002 when Agrawal, Kayal and
                  Saxena came with an algorithm, popularly known as
                  the AKS algorithm, which could test whether a given
                  number is prime or composite in polynomial
                  time. This project is an attempt at understanding
                  the ingenious idea behind this algorithm and the

                  required to study it. In fact, through out this

                  make it as much self contained as possible. Finally,

  abstract	  = {Like termination, confluence is a central
                  property of rewrite systems. Unlike for termination,
                  however, there exists no known complexity hierarchy
                  for confluence. In this paper we investigate whether
                  the decreasing diagrams technique can be used to
                  obtain such a hierarchy. The decreasing diagrams
                  technique is one of the strongest and most versatile
                  methods for proving confluence of abstract rewrite
                  systems. It is complete for countable systems, and
                  it has many well-known confluence criteria as
                  corollaries.  So what makes decreasing diagrams so
                  powerful? In contrast to other confluence
                  techniques, decreasing diagrams employ a labelling
                  of the steps with labels from a well-founded order
                  in order to conclude confluence of the underlying
                  unlabelled relation. Hence it is natural to ask how
                  the size of the label set influences the strength of
                  the technique. In particular, what class of abstract
                  rewrite systems can be proven confluent using
                  decreasing diagrams restricted to 1 label, 2 labels,
                  3 labels, and so on? Surprisingly, we find that two
                  labels suffice for proving confluence for every
                  abstract rewrite system having the cofinality
                  property, thus in particular for every confluent,
                  countable system.  Secondly, we show that this
                  result stands in sharp contrast to the situation for
                  commutation of rewrite relations, where the
                  hierarchy does not collapse.  Thirdly, investigating
                  the possibility of a confluence hierarchy, we
                  determine the first-order (non-)definability of the
                  notion of confluence and related properties, using
                  techniques from finite model theory. We find that in
                  particular Hanf's theorem is fruitful for elegant
                  proofs of undefinability of properties of abstract
                  rewrite systems.},

  abstract	  = {We define an observability property for a
                  calculus with pattern matching which is inspired by
                  the notion of solvability for the
                  lambda-calculus. We prove that observability can be
                  characterized by means of typability and
                  inhabitation in an intersection type system P based
                  on non-idempotent types. We show first that the
                  system P characterizes the set of terms having
                  canonical form, i.e. that a term is typable if and
                  only if it reduces to a canonical form. But the set
                  of observable terms is properly contained in the set
                  of canonical. Thus, typability alone is not
                  sufficient to characterize observability, in
                  contrast to the solvability case for
                  lambda-calculus. We then prove that typability,
                  together with inhabitation, provides a full
                  characterization of observability, in the sense that
                  a term is observable if and only if it is typable
                  and the types of all its arguments are inhabited. We
                  complete the picture by providing an algorithm for
                  the inhabitation problem of P.},

  abstract	  = {The first seeds of mathematical intuitionism
                  germinated in Europe over a century ago in the
                  constructive tendencies of Borel, Baire, Lebesque,
                  Poincar\'e, Kronecker and others. The flowering was
                  the work of one man, Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer,
                  who taught mathematics at the University of
                  Amsterdam from 1909 until 1951. By proving powerful
                  theorems on topological invariants and fixed points
                  of continuous mappings, Brouwer quickly build a
                  mathematical reputation strong enough to support his
                  revolutionary ideas about the nature of mathematical
                  activity. These ideas influenced Hilbert and G\"odel
                  and established intuitionistic logic and mathematics
                  as subjects worthy of independent study.  Our aim is
                  to describe the development of Brouwer's
                  intuitionism, from his rejection of the classical
                  law of excluded middle to his controversial theory
                  of the continuum, with fundamental consequences for
                  logic and mathematics. We borrow Kleene's formal
                  axiomatic systems (incorporating earlier attempts by
                  Kolmogorov, Glivenko, Heyting and Peano) for
                  intuitionistic logic and arithmetic as subtheories
                  of the corresponding classical theories, and sketch
                  his use of g\"odel numbers of recursive functions to
                  realize sentences of intuitionistic arithmetic
                  including a form of Church's Thesis. Finally, we
                  present Kleene and Vesley's axiomatic treatment of
                  Brouwer's continuum, with the function-realizability
                  interpretation which establishes its consistency.},
