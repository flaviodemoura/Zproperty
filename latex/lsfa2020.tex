\begin{abstract}
  Rewriting theory is a well established model of computation
  equivalent to the Turing machines, and the most well known rewriting
  system is the $\lambda$-calculus. Confluence is an important and
  undecidable property related to the determinism of the computational
  process. Direct proofs of confluence are, in general, difficult to
  be done. Therefore, alternative characterizations of confluence can
  circumvent this difficulty for different contexts. This is the case
  of the so called Z property, which has been successfully used to
  prove confluence in several situations such as the
  $\lambda$-calculus with $\beta\eta$-reduction, extensions of the
  $\lambda$-calculus with explicit substitutions, the
  $\lambda\mu$-calculus, etc. In this work we present a constructive
  proof that the Z property implies confluence. The known proofs of
  this fact usually rely on the law of the excluded middle. In
  addition, we formalized our proof and an extension of the Z
  property, known as the Compositional Z, in the Coq proof assistant.

\section{Introduction}



Confluence is an important and undecidable property concerning the
determinism of the computational process. In this sense one says that
a program is confluent if every two ways of evaluating it result in
the very same answer. In the particular case of Abstract Rewriting
Systems (ARS), which are the focus of this work, confluence can be
beautifully expressed by diagrams as we will see in the next section.

The contributions of this work are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We present a new proof that the Z property implies confluence,
  which is constructive and based on nested induction.
\item The proof that the Z property implies confluence is formalized
  in the Coq proof assistant, and the presentation is made
  interleaving English followed by the corresponding Coq code. In this
  way, the annotations are done directly in the Coq files using the
  coqdoc annotation style. We believe that this approach is
  interesting for those that are not familiar with the Coq proof
  assistant because the English explanation followed by the
  corresponding Coq code gives a good idea on how they relate to each
  other. This discipline also forces a better organization of the
  formalization and of the proofs so that the explanation in English
  is comprehensible.
\item We formalize an extension of the Z property, known as
  compositional Z property, as presented in
  \cite{Nakazawa-Fujita2016}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}


Our work provides an intuitionist framework that can be used to prove 
confluence of innumerous ARSs in a rigorously tested proof management 
system, the Coq proof assistent. As a motivation to use the relation 
between the Z property and confluence, we present a type of $\lambda$-calculus 
with explicit substitutions \cite{kes09}. Although their work relies on the 
law of the excluded middle, the proof can be written following intuitionist rules only.

The main advantage of this type of work is its flexibility. When trying to prove 
confluence of a computational process or processes, instead of working on a 
case-by-case basis, one can (when applicable) prove that it has the Z property.
This way, proofs of confluence of similar ARSs can be adapted with much more ease, 
largely skipping the repetitive process of proving the necessary conditions the ARS 
has to obey for it to be confluent.

Furthermore, we hope the work shown here may inspire future studies of the confluence 
of diverse ARSs.
