Rewriting theory is a well established model of computation that has
the lambda-calculus as the most well known example. Confluence is an
important property of rewriting systems that concerns about the
determinism of the computational steps. In this work, we present a
formalisation in the Coq proof assistant that the Z property implies
confluence for abstract rewriting systems. As an application, we show
how it can be used to prove confluence of a calculus with explicit
substitutions.
