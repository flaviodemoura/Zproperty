Rewriting theory is a well established model of computation that has
the lambda-calculus as the most well known example. Confluence is an
important property of rewriting systems that concerns about the
determinism of the computational steps. In this work, we present a
characterization of confluence based on the so called Z property. As
an application, we show how it can be used to get confluence of an
extension of the lambda-calculus with explicit substitutions.
