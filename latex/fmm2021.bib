Lambda-calculus is treated here as a functional language and its relevance to computer science is clearly demonstrated. The main purpose of the book is to provide computer science students and researchers with a firm background in lambda-calculus and combinators and show the applicabillity of these theories to functional programming. The presentation of the material is self-contained. It can be used as a primary text for a course on functional programming. It can also be used as a supplementary text for courses on the structure and implementation of programming languages, theory of computing, or semantics of programming languages.},

We study this approach from a programming-language perspective. We define two small languages that support decision-making abstractions: one with choices and rewards, and the other additionally with probabilities. We give both operational and denotational semantics. The operational semantics combine the usual semantics of standard constructs with optimization over a space of possible executions. The denotational semantics, which are compositional and can also be viewed as an implementation by translation to a simpler language, rely on the selection monad. We establish that the two semantics coincide in both cases.},

The former dates back several centuries, while the latter is widely used in proof systems such as Agda and Coq. Here we show that the two definitions are isomorphic: we can convert any proof of Leibniz equality to one of Martin-L{\"o}f identity and vice versa, and each conversion followed by the other is the identity. One direction of the isomorphism depends crucially on values of the type corresponding to Leibniz equality satisfying functional extensionality and Reynolds' notion of parametricity. The existence of the conversions is widely known (meaning that if one can prove one equality then one can prove the other), but that the two conversions form an isomorphism (internally) in the presence of parametricity and functional extensionality is, we believe, new. Our result is a special case of a more general relation that holds between inductive families and their Church encodings. Our proofs are given inside type theory, rather than meta-theoretically. Our paper is a literate Agda script.},

We give a modern view of this well-understood problem by formulating our LR on well-typed terms. Using this case study, we share some of the lessons learned tackling this problem in different dependently typed proof environments. In particular, we consider the mechanization in Beluga, a proof environment that supports higher-order abstract syntax encodings and contrast it to the development and strategies used in general-purpose proof assistants such as Coq and Agda. The goal of this paper is to engage the community in discussions on what support in proof environments is needed to truly bring mechanized metatheory to the masses and engage said community in the crafting of future benchmarks.},

In his calculus, functions can be encoded to expressions and continuations using primitive operators. That is, the duality of functions is not derived in the calculus but adopted as a principle of the calculus. In this paper, we propose a simple symmetric lambda-calculus corresponding to the negation-free natural deduction based bilateralism in proof-theoretic semantics. In our calculus, continuation types are represented as not negations of formulae but formulae with negative polarity. Function types are represented as the implication and but-not connectives in intuitionistic and paraconsistent logics, respectively. Our calculus is not only simple but also powerful as it includes a call-value calculus corresponding to the call-by-value dual calculus invented by Wadler. We show that mutual transformations between expressions and continuations are definable in our calculus to justify the duality of functions. We also show that every typable function has dual types. Thus, the duality of function is derived from bilateralism.},

Although families of lambda-terms for which the former is exponentially less efficient than the latter do exist, it is currently unknown how {\textbackslash}emph\{general\} this phenomenon is, and how far the inefficiencies can go, in the worst case. We answer these questions formulating four different well-known abstract machines inside a common definitional framework, this way being able to give sharp results about the relative time efficiencies. We also prove that non-idempotent intersection type theories are able to precisely reflect the time performances of the interactive abstract machine, this way showing that its time-inefficiency ultimately descends from the presence of higher-order types.},

Our technique is both simpler and more powerful, as it works in cases where Takahishi's does not. We then pair factorization with two other abstract properties, defining {\textbackslash}emphessential systems, and show that normalization follows. Concretely, we apply the technique to four case studies, two classic ones, head and the leftmost-outermost reductions, and two less classic ones, non-deterministic weak call-by-value and least-level reductions.}

In particular, we isolate a simple sufficient condition (called linear swap) for lifting factorization from components to the compound system. We then closely analyze some common factorization schemas for the lambda-calculus, and show that the technique simplifies even more, reducing to the test of elementary local commutations. Concretely, we apply our technique to diverse extensions of the {$\lambda$}-calculus, among which de' Liguoro and Piperno's non-deterministic lambda-calculus and -- for call-by-value -- Carraro and Guerrieri's shuffling calculus.

We introduce a machine that is simple and efficient: it does not use labels and it implements open call-by-value within a bilinear overhead. Moreover, we provide a new fine understanding of how different optimizations impact on the complexity of the overhead.},

  abstract = {Contextual equivalence is the de facto standard notion of program equivalence. A key theorem is that contextual equivalence is an equational theory. Making contextual equivalence more intensional, for example taking into account the time cost of the computation, seems a natural refinement. Such a change, however, does not induce an equational theory, for an apparently essential reason: cost is not invariant under reduction. In the paradigmatic case of the untyped \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-calculus, we introduce interaction equivalence. Inspired by game semantics, we observe the number of interaction steps between terms and contexts but -- crucially -- ignore their own internal steps. We prove that interaction equivalence is an equational theory and we characterize it as \$B\$, the well-known theory induced by B{\textbackslash}"ohm tree equality. Ours is the first observational characterization of \$B\$ obtained without enriching the discriminating power of contexts with extra features such as non-determinism. To prove our results, we develop interaction-based refinements of the B{\textbackslash}"ohm-out technique and of intersection types.},

To better understand how duplication and erasure can be combined, we design a degenerated calculus, dubbed call-by-silly, that is symmetric to call-by-need in that it merges the worst of call-by-name and call-by-value, namely silly duplications by-name and silly erasures by-value. We validate the design of the call-by-silly calculus via rewriting properties and multi types. In particular, we mirror the main theorem about call-by-need -- that is, its operational equivalence with call-by-name -- showing that call-by-silly and call-by-value induce the same contextual equivalence. This fact shows the blindness with respect to efficiency of call-by-value contextual equivalence. We also define a call-by-silly strategy and measure its length via tight multi types. Lastly, we prove that the call-by-silly strategy computes evaluation sequences of maximal length in the calculus.},

The literature contains a normal form bisimilarity for Plotkin's call-by-value \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-calculus, Lassen's {\textbackslash}emph\{enf bisimilarity\}, which validates all of Moggi's monadic laws and can be extended to validate \${\textbackslash}eta\$. It does not validate, however, other relevant principles, such as the identification of meaningless terms -- validated instead by Sangiorgi's bisimilarity -- or the commutation of \${\textbackslash}letexp\$s. These shortcomings are due to issues with open terms of Plotkin's calculus. We introduce a new call-by-value normal form bisimilarity, deemed {\textbackslash}emph\{net bisimilarity\}, closer in spirit to Sangiorgi's and satisfying the additional principles. We develop it on top of an existing formalism designed for dealing with open terms in call-by-value. It turns out that enf and net bisimilarities are {\textbackslash}emph\{incomparable\}, as net bisimilarity does not validate Moggi's laws nor \${\textbackslash}eta\$. Moreover, there is no easy way to merge them. To better understand the situation, we provide an analysis of the rich range of possible call-by-value normal form bisimilarities, relating them to Ehrhard's relational model.},

To model proof assistants, however, strong evaluation and open terms are required, and it is well known that the operational semantics of call-by-value becomes problematic in this case. Here we study the intermediate setting -- that we call Open Call-by-Value -- of weak evaluation with open terms, on top of which Gr{\textbackslash}'egoire and Leroy designed the abstract machine of Coq. Various calculi for Open Call-by-Value already exist, each one with its pros and cons. This paper presents a detailed comparative study of the operational semantics of four of them, coming from different areas such as the study of abstract machines, denotational semantics, linear logic proof nets, and sequent calculus. We show that these calculi are all equivalent from a termination point of view, justifying the slogan Open Call-by-Value.},

De Carvalho showed how multi types, a quantitative variant of intersection types providing a handy presentation of the relational denotational model, allows one to extract precise bounds on the number of \${\textbackslash}beta\$-steps and the size of normal forms. In the last few years, de Carvalho's work has been extended and adapted to a number of lambda calculi, evaluation strategies, and abstract machines. These works, however, only adapt the first part of his work, that extracts bounds from multi type derivations, while never consider the second part, which deals with extracting bounds from the multi types themselves. The reason is that this second part is more technical, and requires to reason up to type substitutions. It is however also the most interesting, because it shows that the bounding power is inherent to the relational model (which is induced by the types, without the derivations), independently of its presentation as a type system. Here we dissect and clarify the second part of de Carvalho's work, establishing a link with principal multi types, and isolating a key property independent of type substitutions.},

Here, we study the external strategy using a semantical tool, namely Ehrhard's call-by-value multi types, a variant of intersection types. We show that the external strategy terminates exactly when a term is typable with so-called shrinking multi types, mimicking similar results for strong call-by-name. Additionally, the external strategy is normalizing in the untyped setting, that is, it reaches the normal form whenever it exists. We also consider the call-by-extended-value approach to strong evaluation shown reasonable for time by Biernacka et al. The two approaches turn out to not be equivalent: terms may be externally divergent but terminating for call-by-extended-value.},

Since the nineties, it is known that weak (that is, out of abstractions) call-by-value evaluation is a reasonable strategy while L{\textbackslash}'evy's optimal parallel strategy, which is strong (that is, it reduces everywhere), is not. The strong case turned out to be subtler than the weak one. In 2014 Accattoli and Dal Lago have shown that strong call-by-name is reasonable, by introducing a new form of useful sharing and, later, an abstract machine with an overhead quadratic in the number of beta-steps. Here we show that strong call-by-value evaluation is also reasonable, via a new abstract machine realizing useful sharing and having a linear overhead. Moreover, our machine uses a new mix of sharing techniques, adding on top of useful sharing a form of implosive sharing, which on some terms brings an exponential speed-up. We give an example of family that the machine executes in time logarithmic in the number of beta-steps.},

In particular, unsolvable terms provide a consistent notion of meaningless term. The semantics of the untyped call-by-value lambda-calculus (CbV) is instead still in its infancy, because of some inherent difficulties but also because CbV solvable terms are less studied and understood than in call-by-name. On the one hand, we show that a carefully crafted presentation of CbV allows us to recover many of the properties that solvability has in call-by-name, in particular qualitative and quantitative characterizations via multi types. On the other hand, we stress that, in CbV, solvability plays a different role: identifying unsolvable terms as meaningless induces an inconsistent theory.},

We also use these translations to introduce a terminating tableau system for the logics we study, based on Kozen's tableau for the {\textmu}-calculus, and the one of Fitting and Massacci for modal logic. Finally, we show how to encode the tableaux we introduced into {\textmu}-calculus formulas. This encoding provides upper bounds for the satisfiability checking of the few logics we previously did not have algorithms for.},

From our proof of decidability, we obtain a certified and executable type checker for a full-fledged version of MLTT with support for {$\Pi$}, {$\Sigma$}, {$\mathbb{N}$}, and Id types, and one universe. Our development does not rely on impredicativity, induction-recursion or any axiom beyond MLTT extended with indexed inductive types and a handful of predicative universes, thus narrowing the gap between the object theory and the metatheory to a mere difference in universes. Furthermore, our formalization choices are geared towards a modular development that relies on Coq's features, e.g. universe polymorphism and metaprogramming with tactics.},

Proving the first FTC in this way has the advantage of decomposing into loosely-coupled theories of moderate size and of independent interest that lend themselves well to incremental and collaborative development. We explain how we formalize all the topological constructs and all the standard lemmas needed to eventually relate the definitions of derivability and of Lebesgue integration of MathComp-Analysis, a formalization of analysis developed on top of the Mathematical Components library. In the course of this experiment, we substantially enrich MathComp-Analysis and even devise a new proof for Urysohn's lemma.},

Our formalization takes place in UniMath, a library of univalent mathematics based on the Coq proof assistant.   All the categorical structures we formalize are based on monoidal categories. As such, one of our contributions is a practical, usable library of formalized results on monoidal categories. Monoidal categories carry a lot of structure, and instances of monoidal categories are often built from complicated mathematical objects. This can cause challenges of scalability, regarding both the vast amount of data to be managed by the user of the library, as well as the time the proof assistant spends on checking code. To enable scalability, and to avoid duplication of computer code in the formalization, we develop "displayed monoidal categories". These gadgets allow for the modular construction of complicated monoidal categories by building them in layers; we demonstrate their use in many examples. Specifically, we define linear-non-linear categories and construct instances of them via Lafont categories and linear categories.},

It teaches you how to take smart notes and ensure they bring you and your projects forward. The Take Smart Notes principle is based on established psychological insight and draws from a tried and tested note-taking-technique. This is the first comprehensive guide and description of this system in English, and not only does it explain how it works, but also why. It suits students and academics in the social sciences and humanities, nonfiction writers and others who are in the business of reading, thinking and writing. Instead of wasting your time searching for notes, quotes or references, you can focus on what really counts: thinking, understanding and developing new ideas in writing. It does not matter if you prefer taking notes with pen and paper or on a computer, be it Windows, Mac or Linux. And you can start right away.},

  abstract = {In type theory, we can express many practical ideas by attributing some additional data to expressions we operate on during compilation. For instance, some substructural type theories augment variables' typing judgments with the information of their usage. That is, they allow one to explicitly state how many times - 0, 1, or many - a variable can be used. This solves the problem of resource usage control and allows us to treat variables as resources. What's more, it often happens that this attributed information is interpreted (used) during the same compilation and erased before we run a program. A case in the point is that in the same substructural type theories, their type checkers use these 0, 1, or many, to ensure that all variables are used as many times as these attributions say them to be. Yet, there wasn't any programming language concept whose concern would be to allow a programmer to express these attributions in the language itself. That is, to let the programmer express which data the one wants to attribute to what expressions and, most importantly, the meaning of the attributed data in their program. As it turned out, the presence of such a concept allows us to express many practical ideas in the language itself. For instance, with appropriate means for assigning the meaning of these attributions, this concept would allow one to express linear types as functionality in a separate program module, without the need to refine the whole type system to add them. In this paper, we present such a concept - we propose type properties. It allows a programmer to express these attributions while fulfilling the requirement of being fully on the static level. That is, it allows one to express how to interpret these attributions during compilation and erases them before a program is passed to the runtime.},

In the past, implementing and reasoning about programming languages required careful handling to maintain the correct behaviour of bound variables. Modern programming languages include features that enable constraints like scope safety to be expressed in types. Nevertheless, the programmer is still forced to write the same boilerplate over again for each new implementation of a scope safe operation (e.g., renaming, substitution, desugaring, printing, etc.), and then again for correctness proofs.             We present an expressive universe of syntaxes with binding and demonstrate how to (1) implement scope safe traversals once and for all by generic programming; and (2) how to derive properties of these traversals by generic proving. Our universe description, generic traversals and proofs, and our examples have all been formalised in Agda and are available in the accompanying material.

So far, the main approaches to directed type theory proceed in a ``somewhat indirect'' manner: axiomatizing the directed interval type and defining the machinery of directed type theory in terms of it. In this paper, we take the first step towards a `directed homotopy type theory without the directed interval' by developing a directed analogue of Hofmann and Streicher's groupoid model---the category model. The directed type theory this models is adequate for synthetic 1-category theory; the extent to which this approach extends to higher dimensions is the subject of ongoing investigation. Moreover, since the semantics of this theory are expressed in terms of categories with families, these results promise to interface elegantly with current research into generalized algebraic theories and (higher) observational type theory.},

To model such programming languages, we use a (weak and closed) \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-calculus integrating a pattern matching mechanism on algebraic data types (ADTs). Remarkably, we also show that this language not only encodes Plotkin's CBV and CBN \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-calculus as well as other subsuming frameworks, such as the bang-calculus, but can also be used to interpret the semantics of effectful languages with exceptions. After a thorough study of the untyped language, we introduce a type system based on intersection types, and we show through purely logical methods that the set of terminating terms of the language corresponds exactly to that of well-typed terms. Moreover, by considering non-idempotent intersection types, this characterization turns out to be quantitative, i.e. the size of the type derivation of a term t gives an upper bound for the number of evaluation steps from t to its normal form.},

  abstract = {In this work, we develop a polymorphic record calculus with extensible records. Extensible records are records that can have new fields added to them, or preexisting fields removed from them. We also develop a static type system for this calculus and a sound and complete type inference algorithm. Most ML-style polymorphic record calculi that support extensible records are based on row variables. We present an alternative construction based on the polymorphic record calculus developed by Ohori. Ohori based his polymorphic record calculus on the idea of kind restrictions. This allowed him to express polymorphic operations on records such as field selection and modification. With the addition of extensible types, we were able to extend Ohori's original calculus with other powerful operations on records such as field addition and removal.},

We extend the MetaCoq erasure output language with typing information and use it as an intermediate representation, which we call \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textasciicircum}T\_{\textbackslash}square\$. We complement the extraction functionality with a full pipeline that includes several standard transformations (eta-expansion, inlining, etc) implemented in a proof-generating manner along with a verified optimisation pass removing unused arguments. We prove the pass correct wrt. a conventional call-by-value operational semantics of functional languages. From the optimised \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textasciicircum}T\_{\textbackslash}square\$ representation, we obtain code in two functional smart contract languages (Liquidity and CameLIGO), the functional language Elm, and a subset of the multi-paradigm language for systems programming Rust. Rust is currently gaining popularity as a language for smart contracts, and we demonstrate how our extraction can be used to extract smart contract code for the Concordium network. The development is done in the context of the ConCert framework that enables smart contract verification. We contribute with two verified real-world smart contracts (boardroom voting and escrow), which we use, among other examples, to exemplify the applicability of the pipeline. In addition, we develop a verified web application and extract it to fully functional Elm code. In total, this gives us a way to write dependently typed programs in Coq, verify, and then extract them to several target languages while retaining a small trusted computing base of only MetaCoq and the pretty-printers into these languages.},

Benchmarks show that my implementation runs significantly faster than the library implementation, because (1) Red-Black trees avoid the significant overhead of arithmetic incurred by AVL trees for balancing computations; (2) a specialized delete-min operation makes priority-queue operations much faster; and (3) dynamically choosing between three algorithms for set union/intersection leads to better asymptotic efficiency.},

  journal = {CoRR},
  abstract = {It is well known that the length of a beta-reduction sequence of a simply typed lambda-term of order k can be huge; it is as large as k-fold exponential in the size of the lambda-term in the worst case. We consider the following relevant question about quantitative properties, instead of the worst case: how many simply typed lambda-terms have very long reduction sequences? We provide a partial answer to this question, by showing that asymptotically almost every simply typed lambda-term of order k has a reduction sequence as long as (k-1)-fold exponential in the term size, under the assumption that the arity of functions and the number of variables that may occur in every subterm are bounded above by a constant. To prove it, we have extended the infinite monkey theorem for strings to a parametrized one for regular tree languages, which may be of independent interest. The work has been motivated by quantitative analysis of the complexity of higher-order model checking.}

In this paper we refine Xi's analysis, obtaining much better bounds, especially for computations producing small normal forms. For instance, for terms reducing to a boolean, we are able to prove that the length of the standard reduction is at most a mere factorial of the length of the shortest reduction sequence. The methodological innovation of our approach is that instead to try to count the cost for producing something, as customary, we count the cost of consuming things. The key observation is that the part of a {$\lambda$}-term that is needed to produce the normal form (or an arbitrary rigid prefix) may rapidly augment along a computation, but can only decrease very slowly (actually, linearly).},

In this paper, we give sufficient conditions for (local) confluence of closed nominal rewriting theories, based on the analysis of rule overlaps. More precisely, we show that closed nominal rewriting rules where all proper critical pairs are joinable are locally confluent. We also show how to refine the notion of rule overlap to derive confluence of the closed rewriting relation. The conditions that we define are easy to check using a nominal unification algorithm.},

Numerous works have illustrated the usefulness of these calculi for practical notions like the implementation of typed functional programming languages and higher order proof assistants. It has also been shown that eta-reduction is useful for adapting substitution calculi for practical problems like higher order unification. This paper concentrates on rewrite rules for eta-reduction in three different styles of explicit substitution calculi: {$\lambda\sigma$} , {$\lambda$}se and the suspension calculus. Both {$\lambda\sigma$} and {$\lambda$}se when extended with eta-reduction rules, have proved useful for solving higher order unification. We enlarge the suspension calculus with an adequate eta-reduction rule which we show to preserve termination and confluence of the associated substitution calculus and to correspond to the eta rules of the other two calculi. We prove that {$\lambda\sigma$} and {$\lambda$}se as well as {$\lambda\sigma$} and the suspension calculus are non-comparable while {$\lambda$}se is more adequate than the suspension calculus in simulating one-step beta-reduction.},

We show that the standard freshness relation between atoms and terms can be derived from the more primitive notion of permutation fixed-point, and use this result to prove the correctness of the new \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-equivalence axiomatisation. This gives rise to a new notion of nominal unification, where solutions for unification problems are pairs of a fixed-point context and a substitution. Although it may seem less natural than the standard notion of nominal unifier based on freshness constraints, the notion of unifier based on fixed-point constraints behaves better when equational theories are considered: for example, nominal unification remains finitary in the presence of commutativity, whereas it becomes infinitary when unifiers are expressed using freshness contexts. We provide a definition of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-equivalence modulo equational theories that take into account A, C and AC theories. Based on this notion of equivalence, we show that C-unification is finitary and we provide a sound and complete C-unification algorithm, as a first step towards the development of nominal unification modulo AC and other equational theories with permutative properties.},

However, what if we go a step further and ask about the meaning of a proof as a whole? In this paper we address this question and lay out a framework to distinguish sense and denotation of proofs. Two questions are central here. First of all, if we have two (syntactically) different derivations, does this always lead to a difference, firstly, in sense, and secondly, in denotation? The other question is about the relation between different kinds of proof systems (here: natural deduction vs. sequent calculi) with respect to this distinction. Do the different forms of representing a proof necessarily correspond to a difference in how the inferential steps are given? In our framework it will be possible to identify denotation as well as sense of proofs not only within one proof system but also between different kinds of proof systems. Thus, we give an account to distinguish a mere syntactic divergence from a divergence in meaning and a divergence in meaning from a divergence of proof objects analogous to Frege's distinction for singular terms and sentences.},

Then the elimination of redundancy in LK-proofs is performed by a resolution method in the following way. A set of clauses C is assigned to an LK-proof {$\psi$} and it is shown that C is always unsatisfiable. A resolution refutation of C then serves as a skeleton of an LK-proof {$\psi\prime$} with atomic cuts;{$\psi\prime$} can be constructed from the resolution proof and {$\psi$} by a projection method. In the final step the atomic cuts are eliminated and a cut-free proof is obtained. The complexity of the method is analyzed and it is shown that a non-elementary speed-up over Gentzen's method can be achieved. Finally an application to automated deduction is presented: it is demonstrated how informal proofs (containing pseudo-cuts) can be transformed into formal ones by the method of redundancy-elimination; moreover, the method can even be used to transform incorrect proofs into correct ones.},

We show that the only first-order Goedel logics that admit such prenex forms are those with finite truth value sets since they allow all quantifier-shift rules and the logic \$G\_{\textbackslash}uparrow\$ with only one accumulation point at 1 in the infinite truth value set. In all the other cases, there are generally no logically equivalent prenex normal forms. We will also see that \$G\_{\textbackslash}uparrow\$ is the intersection of all finite first-order Goedel logics. The second part of this paper investigates the existence of effective equivalence between the validity of a formula and the validity of some prenex normal form. The existence of such a normal form is obvious for finite valued Goedel logic and \$G\_{\textbackslash}uparrow\$. Goedel logics with an uncountable truth value set admit the prenex normal forms if and only if every surrounding of 0 is uncountable or 0 is an isolated point. Otherwise, uncountable Goedel logics are not recursively enumerable, however, the prenex fragment is always recursively enumerable. Therefore, there is no effective translation between the valid formula and the valid prenex normal form. However, the existence of effectively constructible validity equivalent prenex forms for the countable case is still up for debate.},

Structured derivations added nested subderivations and inherited assumptions to this style. This paper introduces further extensions of the structured derivation format, and gives a precise syntax and semantics for the extended proof style. The extensions provide a unification of the three main proof styles used in mathematics today: Hilbert-style forward chaining proofs, Gentzen-style backward chaining proofs and algebraic derivations and calculations (in particular, Dijkstra's calculational proof style). Each of these proof styles can now be directly presented as a structured derivation. Even more importantly, the three proof styles can be freely intermixed in a single structured derivation, allowing different proof styles to be used in different parts of the derivation, each time choosing the proof style that is most suitable for the (sub)problem at hand. We describe here (extended) structured derivations, feature by feature, and illustrate each feature with examples. We show how to model the three main proof styles as structured derivations. We give an exact syntax for structured derivations and define their semantics by showing how a structured derivation can be automatically translated into an equivalent Gentzen-style sequent calculus derivation. Structured derivations have been primarily developed for teaching mathematics at the secondary and tertiary education level. The syntax of structured derivations determines the general structure of the proof, but does not impose any restrictions on how the basic notions of the underlying mathematical domain are treated. Hence, the style can be used for any kind of proofs, calculations, derivations, and general problem solving found in mathematics education at these levels. The precise syntax makes it easy to provide computer support for structured derivations.},

Such specifications have a natural rendition in logics that support fixed-point definitions. Another useful formalization device is that of recursive specifications. These specifications are not directly complemented by fixed-point reasoning techniques and, correspondingly, do not have to satisfy strong monotonicity restrictions. We show how to incorporate a rewriting capability into logics of fixed-point definitions towards additionally supporting recursive specifications. Specifically, we describe a natural deduction calculus that adds a form of "closed-world'' equality - a key ingredient to supporting fixed-point definitions - to deduction modulo, a framework for extending a logic with a rewriting layer operating on formulas. We show that our calculus enjoys strong normalizability when the rewrite system satisfies general properties and we demonstrate its usefulness in specifying and reasoning about syntax-based descriptions. Our integration of closed-world equality into deduction modulo is based on an elimination principle for this form of equality that, for the first time, allows us to require finiteness of proofs without sacrificing stability under reduction.},

The studied properties and their proofs are formalized in a very expressive (non linear) inductive logic: the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC). The examples we have considered so far are relatively simple ones; however, all coming with formal semi-automatic proofs in the Coq system, which implements CIC. In neuroscience, we are directly using CIC and Coq, to model neurons and some simple neuronal circuits and prove some of their dynamic properties. \% In biomedicine, the study of multi omic pathway interactions, together with clinical and electronic health record data should help in drug discovery and disease diagnosis.

  abstract = {We present a call-by-need strategy for computing strong normal forms of open terms (reduction is admitted inside the body of abstractions and substitutions, and the terms may contain free variables), which guarantees that arguments are only evaluated when needed and at most once. The strategy is shown to be complete with respect to               {$\beta$}               -reduction to strong normal form. The proof of completeness relies on two key tools: (1) the definition of a strong call-by-need calculus where reduction may be performed inside any context, and (2) the use of non-idempotent intersection types. More precisely, terms admitting a               {$\beta$}               -normal form in pure lambda calculus are typable, typability implies (weak) normalisation in the strong call-by-need calculus, and weak normalisation in the strong call-by-need calculus implies normalisation in the strong call-by-need strategy. Our (strong) call-by-need strategy is also shown to be conservative over the standard (weak) call-by-need.},

A notable result achieved by Accattoli and Dal Lago is that leftmost-outermost reduction is reasonable, where the term representation uses sharing and the steps are useful. These results, initially studied in call-by-name, have also been extended to call-by-value. However, the existing formulations of usefulness lack inductive structure, making it challenging in particular to define and reason about type systems on top of the untyped syntax. Additionally, no type-based quantitative interpretations exist for useful evaluation. In this work, we establish the first inductive definition of useful evaluation for open weak call-by-value. This new useful strategy connects to a previous implementation of usefulness through a low-level abstract machine, incurring only in linear time overhead, thus providing a reasonable cost model for open call-by-value implementation. We also propose a semantic interpretation of useful call-by-value using a non-idempotent intersection type system equipped with a notion of tightness. The resulting interpretation is quantitative, i.e. provides exact step-count information for program evaluation. This turns out to be the first semantical interpretation in the literature for a notion of useful evaluation.},

  abstract = {Explicit substitution calculi are variants of the {$\lambda$}-calculus in which the operation of substitution is not de ned at the metalanguage level, but rather implemented by means of rewriting rules. Our main object of study is a particular explicit substitution calculus, the Linear Substitution Calculus (LSC), introduced by Acca oli and Kesner in 2010. Its distinguishing feature is that rewriting rules operate non-locally (at a distance). In this thesis, rst, we de ne abstract machines to implement evaluation strategies in the LSC: call-by-name for weak and strong evaluation, call-by-value, and call-by-need. We prove that these machines are correct and that they preserve computational time complexity. Second, we de ne an extension of the call-by-need evaluation strategy in the LSC for strong reduction. We show that the strong call-by-need strategy is complete with respect to call-by-name, using a non-idempotent intersection type system, and we show how to extend the strategy to deal with pa ern matching and recursion. Finally, we study the theory of residuals and redex families in the LSC. To this aim, we de ne a variant of the LSC endowed with Le{\textasciiacute}vy labels, which allows us to prove that it enjoys the Finite Family Developments property. We apply this property to obtain results on optimality, standardization, and normalization for the LSC, and we generalize some of this results to the axiomatic framework of Deterministic Family Structures.},

Instead, abstractions are decorated with a location, which intuitively may be understood as its memory address, and we impose a simple coherence invariant: abstractions in the same location must be equal. This allows us to formulate a confluent small-step operational semantics which only performs first-order unification and does not require strong evaluation (below lambdas).

A decreasing measure is a function that maps each typable {$\lambda$}-term to an element of a well-founded ordering, in such a way that contracting any {$\beta$}-redex decreases the value of the function, entailing strong normalization. Both measures are defined constructively, relying on an auxiliary calculus, a non-erasing variant of the {$\lambda$}-calculus. In this system, dubbed the {$\lambda$}m-calculus, each {$\beta$}-step creates a ``wrapper'' containing a copy of the argument that cannot be erased and cannot interact with the context in any other way. Both measures rely crucially on the observation, known to Turing and Prawitz, that contracting a redex cannot create redexes of higher degree, where the degree of a redex is defined as the height of the type of its {$\lambda$}-abstraction. The W-measure maps each {$\lambda$}-term to a natural number, and it is obtained by evaluating the term in the {$\lambda$}m-calculus and counting the number of remaining wrappers. The T m-measure maps each {$\lambda$}-term to a structure of nested multisets, where the nesting depth is proportional to the maximum redex degree.},

For that, we first restrict the substitution operation in the Value Substitution Calculus to be linear, yielding the LCBV strategy. We then further restrict substitution in LCBV, so that substitution contributes to the progress of the computation. This optimisation is the UCBV strategy, and its notion of substitution is sensitive to the surrounding evaluation context, so it is non-trivial to capture it inductively. Moreover, we show that UCBV is a sound and complete implementation of LCBV, optimised to implement useful evaluation. As a further contribution, we show that an existing notion of usefulness in the literature, namely the GLAMoUr abstract machine, implements the UCBV strategy with polynomial overhead in time. This establishes that UCBV is time-invariant, i.e., that the number of reduction steps to normal form in UCBV can be used as a measure of time complexity. Defining UCBV leads us to the first semantic model of useful CBV evaluation through system U, a non-idempotent intersection type system. Our main result is a characterisation of termination for useful CBV evaluation via system U: a term is typable in system U if and only if it terminates in UCBV. Additionally, system U provides a quantitative interpretation for UCBV, offering exact step-count information for program evaluation. Even though the specification of the operational semantics of UCBV is highly complex, system U is notably simple. As far as we know, system U is one of the scarce quantitative type systems capturing exactly the substitution step-count for a call-by-value strategy.},

  abstract = {The Functional Machine Calculus (FMC) was recently introduced as a generalization of the lambda-calculus to include higher-order global state, probabilistic and non-deterministic choice, and input and output, while retaining confluence. The calculus can encode both the call-by-name and call-by-value semantics of these effects. This is enabled by two independent generalisations, both natural from the perspective of the FMC's operational semantics, which is given by a simple multi-stack machine. The first generalization decomposes the syntax of the lambda-calculus in a way that allows for sequential composition of terms and the encoding of reduction strategies. Specifically, there exist translations of the call-by-name and call-by-value lambda-calculus which preserve operational semantics. The second parameterizes application and abstraction in terms of 'locations' (corresponding to the multiple stacks of the machine), which gives a unification of the operational semantics, syntax, and reduction rules of the given effects with those of the lambda-calculus. The FMC further comes equipped with a simple type system which restricts and captures the behaviour of effects. This thesis makes two main contributions, showing that two fundamental properties of the lambda-calculus are preserved by the FMC. The first is to show that the categorical semantics of the FMC, modulo an appropriate equational theory, is given by the free Cartesian closed category. The equational theory is validated by a notion of observational equivalence. The second contribution is a proof that typed FMC-terms are strongly normalising. This is an extension (and small simplification) of Gandy's proof for the lambda-calculus, which additionally emphasizes its latent operational intuition.},

  abstract = {We construct a topos in which the Dedekind reals are countable. To accomplish this, we first define a new kind of toposes that we call parameterized realizability toposes. They are built from partial combinatory algebras whose application operation depends on a parameter, and in which realizers operate uniformly with respect to a given parameter set. Our topos is the parameterized realizability topos whose realizers are oracle-computable partial maps, with oracles serving as parameters and ranging over the representations of a non-diagonalizable sequence, discovered by Joseph Miller. It is a sequence of reals in \$[0,1]\$ that is non-diagonalizable in the sense that any real in \$[0,1]\$ that is oracle-computable, uniformly in oracles representing the sequence, must already appear in the sequence. The Dedekind reals are countable in the topos because the non-diagonalizable sequence appears in it as an epimorphism. The topos is intuitionistic, as it invalidates both the law of excluded middle and the axiom of countable choice. The Cauchy reals are uncountable. The Hilbert cube is countable, from which Brouwer's fixed-point theorem follows as an easy corollary of Lawvere's fixed-point theorem. From the 1-dimensional Brouwer's fixed-point theorem we obtain the intermediate value theorem and the lesser limited principle of omniscience. The Kreisel-Lacombe-Shoenfield-Tseitin theorem stating that all real-valued maps are continuous is valid, because the usual proof is uniform with respect to oracles. Lastly, the closed interval \$[0,1]\$, being countable, can trivially be covered by a sequence of open intervals whose lengths add up to any prescribed \$0 {$<$} {\textbackslash}epsilon {$<$} 1\$, and such a cover has no finite subcover. However, we show that any sequence of open intervals with rational endpoints covering \$[0,1]\$ must has a finite subcover.},

The primary aim is pragmatic: to unify and organise their study, allowing results and constructions to be given in reasonable generality, rather than just for specific theories. Compared to other approaches, our definition stays closer to the direct or naive reading of syntax, yielding the traditional presentations of specific theories as closely as possible. Specifically, we give three main definitions: raw type theories, a minimal setup for discussing dependently typed derivability; acceptable type theories, including extra conditions ensuring well-behavedness; and well-presented type theories, generalising how in traditional presentations, the well-behavedness of a type theory is established step by step as the type theory is built up. Following these, we show that various fundamental fitness-for-purpose metatheorems hold in this generality. Much of the present work has been formalised in the proof assistant Coq.},

  abstract = {The tension between deduction and induction is perhaps the most fundamental issue in areas such as philosophy, cognition and artificial intelligence (AI). The deduction camp concerns itself with questions about the expressiveness of formal languages for capturing knowledge about the world, together with proof systems for reasoning from such knowledge bases. The learning camp attempts to generalize from examples about partial descriptions about the world. In AI, historically, these camps have loosely divided the development of the field, but advances in cross-over areas such as statistical relational learning, neuro-symbolic systems, and high-level control have illustrated that the dichotomy is not very constructive, and perhaps even ill-formed. In this article, we survey work that provides further evidence for the connections between logic and learning. Our narrative is structured in terms of three strands: logic versus learning, machine learning for logic, and logic for machine learning, but naturally, there is considerable overlap. We place an emphasis on the following "sore" point: there is a common misconception that logic is for discrete properties, whereas probability theory and machine learning, more generally, is for continuous properties. We report on results that challenge this view on the limitations of logic, and expose the role that logic can play for learning in infinite domains.}

  abstract = {There are two approaches to formalizing the syntax of typed object languages in a proof assistant or programming language. The extrinsic approach is to first define a type that encodes untyped object expressions and then make a separate definition of typing judgements over the untyped terms. The intrinsic approach is to make a single definition that captures well-typed object expressions, so ill-typed expressions cannot even be expressed. Intrinsic encodings are attractive and naturally enforce the requirement that metalanguage operations on object expressions, such as substitution, respect object types. The price is that the metalanguage types of intrinsic encodings and operations involve non-trivial dependency, adding significant complexity. This paper describes intrinsic-style formalizations of both simply-typed and polymorphic languages, and basic syntactic operations thereon, in the Coq proof assistant. The Coq types encoding object-level variables (de Bruijn indices) and terms are indexed by both type and typing environment. One key construction is the boot-strapping of definitions and lemmas about the action of substitutions in terms of similar ones for a simpler notion of renamings. In the simply-typed case, this yields definitions that are free of any use of type equality coercions. In the polymorphic case, some substitution operations do still require type coercions, which we at least partially tame by uniform use of heterogeneous equality.},

  abstract = {Matching logic is a formalism for specifying and reasoning about structures using patterns and pattern matching. Growing in popularity, matching logic has been used to define many logical systems such as separation logic with recursive definitions and linear-temporal logic. Despite this, there is no way for a user to define his or her own matching logic theories using a theorem prover, with maximal assurance of the properties being proved. Hence, in this work, we formalized a version of matching logic using the Coq proof assistant. Specifically, we create a new version of matching logic that uses a locally nameless representation, where quantified variables are unnamed in order to aid verification. We formalize the syntax, semantics, and proof system of this representation of matching logic using the Coq proof assistant. Crucially, we also verify the soundness of the formalized proof system, thereby guaranteeing that any matching logic properties proved in our Coq formalization are indeed correct. We believe this work provides a previously unexplored avenue for defining and proving matching logic theories and properties.},

The interpretation is shown to be sound with respect to a domain-theoretic denotational semantics and a corresponding lazy operational semantics of a functional language for extracted programs. We also show how extracted programs can be translated into Haskell.

  abstract = {When reasoning about inductively defined predicates, such as typing judgements or reduction relations, proofs are often done by inversion, that is by a case analysis on the last rule of a derivation. In HOL and other formal frameworks this case analysis involves solving equational constraints on the arguments of the inductively defined predicates. This is well-understood when the arguments consist of variables or injective term-constructors. However, when alpha-equivalence classes are involved, that is when term-constructors are not injective, these equational constraints give rise to annoying variable renamings. In this paper, we show that more convenient inversion principles can be derived where one does not have to deal with variable renamings. An interesting observation is that our result relies on the fact that inductive predicates must satisfy the variable convention compatibility condition, which was introduced to justify the admissibility of Barendregt's variable convention in rule inductions.},

Such totalised divisions we call common divisions. In a field the two forms are equivalent and we have a finite equational axiomatisation E that is complete for the equational theory of fields equipped with common division, called common meadows. These equational axioms E turn out to be true of commutative rings with common division but only when defined via inverses. We explore these axioms E and their role in seeking a completeness theorem for the conditional equational theory of common meadows. We prove they are complete for the conditional equational theory of commutative rings with inverse based common division. By adding a new proof rule, we can prove a completeness theorem for the conditional equational theory of common meadows. Although, the equational axioms E fail with common division defined directly, we observe that the direct division does satisfies the equations in E under a new congruence for partial terms called eager equality.},

We observe, with a no-go theorem, a crucial tradeoff between graduality and the key properties of canonicity, decidability and closure of universes under dependent product that CIC enjoys. Beyond this Fire Triangle of Graduality, we explore the gradualization of CIC with three different compromises, each relaxing one edge of the Fire Triangle. We develop a parametrized presentation of Gradual CIC that encompasses all three variations, and jointly develop their metatheory. We first present a bidirectional elaboration of Gradual CIC to a dependently-typed cast calculus, which elucidates the interrelation between typing, conversion, and graduality. We then establish the metatheory of this cast calculus through both a syntactic model into CIC, which provides weak canonicity, confluence, and when applicable, normalization, and a monotone model that purports the study of the graduality of two of the three variants. This work informs and paves the way towards the development of malleable proof assistants and dependently-typed programming languages.},

This paper introduces the "gros" semantics in the category of lcc categories: Instead of constructing an interpretation in a given individual lcc category, we show that also the category of all lcc categories can be endowed with the structure of a model of dependent type theory. The original interpretation in an individual lcc category can then be recovered by slicing. As in the original interpretation, we face the issue of coherence: Categorical structure is usually preserved by functors only up to isomorphism, whereas syntactic substitution commutes strictly with all type theoretic structure. Our solution involves a suitable presentation of the higher category of lcc categories as model category. To that end, we construct a model category of lcc sketches, from which we obtain by the formalism of algebraically (co)fibrant objects model categories of strict lcc categories and then algebraically cofibrant strict lcc categories. The latter is our model of dependent type theory.},

This new machine implements a reduction strategy that subsumes the fireball-calculus variant of call by value studied by Accattoli et al. We describe the strong strategy of the machine in terms of a reduction semantics and prove the correctness of the machine using a method based on Biernacka et al.'s generalized refocusing.

  abstract = {We study the seeded domino problem, the recurring domino problem and the k-SAT problem on finitely generated groups. These problems are generalization of their original versions on {$\mathbb{Z}^2$} that were shown to be undecidable using the domino problem. We show that the seeded and recurring domino problems on a group are invariant under changes in the generating set, are many-one reduced from the respective problems on subgroups, and are positive equivalent to the problems on finite index subgroups. This leads to showing that the recurring domino problem is decidable for free groups. Coupled with the invariance properties, we conjecture that the only groups in which the seeded and recurring domino problems are decidable are virtually free groups. In the case of the k-SAT problem, we introduce a new generalization that is compatible with decision problems on finitely generated groups. We show that the subgroup membership problem many-one reduces to the 2-SAT problem, that in certain cases the k-SAT problem many one reduces to the domino problem, and finally that the domino problem reduces to 3-SAT for the class of scalable groups.},

This is an opportunity for trained machine learning predictors, which can guide the work of such reasoning systems. Conversely, deductive search supported by the notion of logically valid proof allows one to train machine learning systems on large reasoning corpora. Such bodies of proof are usually correct by construction and when combined with more and more precise trained guidance they can be boostrapped into very large corpora, with increasingly long reasoning chains and possibly novel proof ideas.},

These are resource terms {\textbackslash}`a la Ehrhard-Regnier, but in infinite \${\textbackslash}eta\$-long form, while retaining a finite syntax and dynamics: in particular, we prove strong confluence and normalization. Then we define an extensional version of Taylor expansion, mapping ordinary \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-terms to sets (or infinite linear combinations) of extensional resource terms: just like for ordinary Taylor expansion, the dynamics of our resource calculus allows to simulate the \${\textbackslash}beta\$-reduction of \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-terms; the extensional nature of expansion shows in that we are also able to simulate \${\textbackslash}eta\$-reduction. In a sense, extensional resource terms form a language of (non-necessarily normal) finite approximants of Nakajima trees, much like ordinary resource terms are approximants of B{\textbackslash}"ohm-trees. Indeed, we show that the equivalence induced on \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-terms by the normalization of extensional Taylor-expansion is nothing but \$H{\textasciicircum}*\$, the greatest consistent sensible \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-theory. Taylor expansion has profoundly renewed the approximation theory of the \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-calculus by providing a quantitative alternative to order-based approximation techniques, such as Scott continuity and B{\textbackslash}"ohm trees. Extensional Taylor expansion enjoys similar advantages: e.g., to exhibit models of \$H{\textasciicircum}*\$, it is now sufficient to provide a model of the extensional resource calculus. We apply this strategy to give a new, elementary proof of a result by Manzonetto: \$H{\textasciicircum}*\$ is the \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-theory induced by a well-chosen reflexive object in the relational model of the \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-calculus.},

Proofs in Coq have a high degree of formality while textbook proofs have only a medium one. Therefore our key idea is to reduce the degree of formality from the level of Coq to textbook proofs in several small steps. For that purpose we introduce three proof styles between Coq and textbook proofs, called line by line comments, weakened line by line comments, and structure faithful proofs. While this article is mostly conceptional we also report on experiences with putting our approach into practise.},

For standard DPO rewriting without interfaces, confluence for terminating rewrite systems is, in general, undecidable. Nevertheless, we show here that confluence for DPOI, and hence string diagram rewriting, is decidable. We apply this result to give effective procedures for deciding local confluence of symmetric monoidal theories with and without Frobenius structure by critical pair analysis. For the latter, we introduce the new notion of path joinability for critical pairs, which enables finitely many joins of a critical pair to be lifted to an arbitrary context in spite of the strong non-local constraints placed on rewriting in a generic symmetric monoidal theory.},

This is achieved by introducing a relation \${\textbackslash}simeq\$, defined over a revised presentation of Parigot's \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}mu\$-calculus we dub \${\textbackslash}Lambda M\$. Our result builds on three main ingredients which guide our semantical development: (1) factorization of Parigot's \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}mu\$-reduction into multiplicative and exponential steps by means of explicit operators, (2) adaptation of Laurent's original \${\textbackslash}simeq\_{\textbackslash}sigma\$-equivalence to \${\textbackslash}Lambda M\$, and (3) interpretation of \${\textbackslash}Lambda M\$ into Laurent's polarized proof-nets (PPN). More precisely, we first give a translation of \${\textbackslash}Lambda M\$-terms into PPN which simulates the reduction relation of our calculus via cut elimination of PPN. Second, we establish a precise correspondence between our relation \${\textbackslash}simeq\$ and Laurent's \${\textbackslash}simeq\_{\textbackslash}sigma\$-equivalence for \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}mu\$-terms. Moreover, \${\textbackslash}simeq\$-equivalent terms translate to structurally equivalent PPN. Most notably, \${\textbackslash}simeq\$ is shown to be a strong bisimulation with respect to reduction in \${\textbackslash}Lambda M\$, i.e. two \${\textbackslash}simeq\$-equivalent terms have the exact same reduction semantics, a result which fails for Regnier's \${\textbackslash}simeq\_{\textbackslash}sigma\$-equivalence in \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-calculus as well as for Laurent's \${\textbackslash}simeq\_{\textbackslash}sigma\$-equivalence in \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}mu\$.},

  abstract = {We extend Bove's technique for formalising simple general recursive algrithms in constructive type theory to nested recursive algorithms. The method consists in defining an inductive special-purpose accessibility predicate, that characterizes the inputs on which the algorithm terminates. As a result, the type-theoretic version of the algorithm can be defined by structural recursion on the proof that the input values satisfy this predicate. This technique results in definitions in which the computational and logical parts are clearly separated; hence, the type-theoretic version of the algorithm is given by its purely functional content, similarly to the corresponding program in a functional programming language. In the case of nested recursion, the special predicate and the type-theoretic algorithm must be defined simultaneously, because they depend on each other. This kind of definitions is not allowed in ordinary type theory, but it is provided in type theories extended with Dybjer's schema for simultaneous inductive-recursive definitions. The technique applies also to the formalisation of partial functions as proper type-theoretic functions, rather than relations representing their graphs.},

Instead of relegating data structures to trivial material used to illustrate object-oriented programming methodology, this is the first volume to show data structures as a crucial algorithmic topic. Numerous code examples in C and more than 500 references make Advanced Data Structures an indispensable text.},

We also show how these formulas allow us to give new proofs for well known properties of the Fibonacci and Lucas sequences. It is well known that there is a correspondence between trigonometric identities and identities with hyperbolic functions. It is our aim to extend this analogy, showing that there is a correspondence between identities of hyperbolic functions and identities of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. To develop these ideas, we also approach a combinatorial identity due to Gould.},

We emphasize that our open-source library is extensible: by taking new categorical constructions (such as slice categories, structured cospans, and distributed graphs) and relating their limits and colimits to those of their underlying categories, users inherit efficient algorithms for pushout complements and (final) pullback complements. This allows one to perform double-, single-, and sesqui-pushout rewriting over a broad class of data structures.},

A recent paper by Zdanowski shows that Glivenko's theorem also holds for secondorder propositional logic without the universal quantifier. We prove that Glivenko's theorem extends to some versions of simple type theory without the universal quantifier. Moreover we prove that Kuroda's negative translation, which is known to embed classical first-order logic into intuitionistic first-order logic, extends to the same versions of simple type theory. We also prove that the Glivenko property fails for simple type theory once a weak form of functional extensionality is included.},

Thus, typability alone is not sufficient to characterize observability, in contrast to the solvability case for lambda-calculus.

It is shown that axiomatic extensions of intuitionistic propositional calculus defining univocally new connectives, including those proposed by Gabbay, are strongly complete with respect to valuations in Heyting algebras with additional operations. In all cases, the double negation of such a connective is equivalent to a formula of intuitionistic calculus. Thus, under the excluded third law it collapses to a classical formula, showing that this condition in Gabbay's definition is redundant. Moreover, such connectives can not be interpreted in all Heyting algebras, unless they are already equivalent to a formula of intuitionistic calculus. These facts relativize to connectives over intermediate logics. In particular, the intermediate logic with values in the chain of length               n               may be ``completed'' conservatively by adding a single unary connective, so that the expanded               system               does not allow further axiomatic extensions by new connectives.},

In this paper, we extend the notion of nominal algebra by introducing fixed-point constraints and provide a sound semantics using strong nominal sets. We show, by providing a counter-example, that the class of nominal sets is not a sound denotation for this extended nominal algebra. To recover soundness we propose two different formulations of nominal algebra, one obtained by restricting to a class of fixed-point contexts that are in direct correspondence with freshness contexts and another obtained by using a different set of derivation rules.},

Properties of programs defined by recursion on the structure of recursive types are generally proved by structural induction on the type. It is well known in the theorem proving community how to generate structural induction principles from data type declarations. These methods deserve to be better know in the functional programming community. Existing functional programming textbooks gloss over this material. And yet, if functional programmers do not know how to write down the structural induction principle for a new type - how are they supposed to reason about it? In this paper we describe an algorithm to generate structural induction principles from data type declarations. We also discuss how these methods are taught in the functional programming course at the University of Wyoming. A Haskell implementation of the algorithm is included in an appendix.}

  abstract = {The transformation of graphs and graph-like structures is ubiquitous in computer science. When a system is described by graph-transformation rules, it is often desirable that the rules are both terminating and confluent so that rule applications in an arbitrary order produce unique resulting graphs. However, there are application scenarios where the rules are not globally confluent but confluent on a subclass of graphs that are of interest. In other words, non-resolvable conflicts can only occur on graphs that are considered as "garbage". In this paper, we introduce the notion of confluence up to garbage and generalise Plump's critical pair lemma for double-pushout graph transformation, providing a sufficient condition for confluence up to garbage by non-garbage critical pair analysis. We apply our results in two case studies about efficient language recognition: we present backtracking-free graph reduction systems which recognise a class of flow diagrams and a class of labelled series-parallel graphs, respectively. Both systems are non-confluent but confluent up to garbage. We also give a critical pair condition for subcommutativity up to garbage which, together with closedness, implies confluence up to garbage even in non-terminating systems.},

Moreover, because the verifier is written in a language which admits formal verification, it is possible to state and prove properties about the kernel itself, and we report on some initial steps taken in this direction to formalize the Lean type theory abstractly and show that the kernel correctly implements this theory, to eliminate the possibility of implementation bugs in the kernel and increase the trustworthiness of proofs conducted in it. This work is still ongoing but we plan to use this project to help justify any future changes to the kernel and type theory and ensure unsoundness does not sneak in through either the abstract theory or implementation bugs.},

We present the evolution of the mathematical contents of the library since former presentations at JFLA meetings. Then, we describe how the structure of the project is determined by two requirements which must be continuously satisfied. First, the Coq code needs to be compatible with its ever-evolving dependencies (the Coq proof assistant and several Coq packages both from inside and outside Coq-community) and reverse dependencies (Coq-community projects that depend on it). Second, the book needs to be consistent with the Coq code, which undergoes frequent changes to improve structure and include new material. We believe Hydras \& Co. demonstrates that books on formalized mathematics are not limited to providing exposition of theories and reasoning techniquesthey can also provide inspiration and entertainment that transcends educational goals.},

Previous results concerning this problem manage to capture fragments of intuitionistic logic, but in many essential cases structural constraints were violated during normal form construction resulting in a classical proof. The heart of the CERES method is the resolution calculus, which ignores the structural constraints of the well known intuitionistic sequent calculi. We propose, as a method of avoiding the structural violations, the generalization of resolution from the resolving of clauses to the resolving of cut-free proofs, in other words, what we call proof resolution. The result of proof resolution is a cut-free proof rather than a clause. Note that resolution on ground clauses is essentially atomic cut, thus using proof resolution to construct cut-free proofs one would need to join the two proofs together and remove the atoms which where resolved. To efficiently perform this joining (and guarantee that the resulting cut-free proof is intuitionistic) we develop the concept of proof subsumption (similar to clause subsumption) and indexed resolution, a refinement indexing atoms by their corresponding positions in the cut formula. Proof subsumption serves as a tool to prove the completeness of the new method CERES-i, and indexed resolution provides an efficient strategy for the joining of two proofs which is in general a nondeterministic search. Such a refinement is essential for any attempt to implement this method. Finally we compare the complexity of CERES-i with that of Gentzen-based methods.},

Alternatively, our problem may be formulated as a recursive procedure calling first-order syntactic unification on certain bindings occurring in the solved form resulting from unification. Loop unification is closely related to Narrowing as the schematic constructions can be seen as a rewrite rule applied during unification, and primal grammars, as we deal with recursive term constructions. However, loop unification relaxes the restrictions put on variables as fresh as well as used extra variables may be introduced by rewriting. In this work we consider an important special case, so called semiloop unification. We provide a sufficient condition for unifiability of the entire sequence based on the structure of a sufficiently long initial segment. It remains an open question whether this condition is also necessary for semiloop unification and how it may be extended to loop unification.},

  abstract = {This paper gives an in-depth presentation of the omni-big-step and omni-small-step styles of semantic judgments. These styles describe operational semantics by relating starting states to sets of outcomes rather than to individual outcomes. A single derivation of these semantics for a particular starting state and program describes all possible nondeterministic executions (hence the name omni), whereas in traditional small-step and big-step semantics, each derivation only talks about one single execution. This restructuring allows for straightforward modeling of both nondeterminism and undefined behavior as commonly encountered in sequential functional and imperative programs. Specifically, omnisemantics inherently assert safety, i.e. they guarantee that none of the execution branches gets stuck, while traditional semantics need either a separate judgment or additional error markers to specify safety in the presence of nondeterminism. Omnisemantics can be understood as an inductively defined weakest-precondition semantics (or more generally, predicate-transformer semantics) that does not involve invariants for loops and recursion but instead uses unrolling rules like in traditional small-step and big-step semantics. Omnisemantics were previously described in association with several projects, but we believe the technique has been underappreciated and deserves a well-motivated, extensive, and pedagogical presentation of its benefits. We also explore several novel aspects associated with these semantics, in particular their use in type-safety proofs for lambda calculi, partial-correctness reasoning, and forward proofs of compiler correctness for terminating but potentially nondeterministic programs being compiled to nondeterministic target languages. All results in this paper are formalized in Coq.

  abstract = {We introduce Nominal Matching Logic (NML) as an extension of Matching Logic with names and binding following the Gabbay-Pitts nominal approach. Matching logic is the foundation of the \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{K\}\$ framework, used to specify programming languages and automatically derive associated tools (compilers, debuggers, model checkers, program verifiers). Matching logic does not include a primitive notion of name binding, though binding operators can be represented via an encoding that internalises the graph of a function from bound names to expressions containing bound names. This approach is sufficient to represent computations involving binding operators, but has not been reconciled with support for inductive reasoning over syntax with binding (e.g., reasoning over \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-terms). Nominal logic is a formal system for reasoning about names and binding, which provides well-behaved and powerful principles for inductive reasoning over syntax with binding, and NML inherits these principles. We discuss design alternatives for the syntax and the semantics of NML, prove meta-theoretical properties and give examples to illustrate its expressive power. In particular, we show how induction principles for \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-terms (\${\textbackslash}alpha\$-structural induction) can be defined and used to prove standard properties of the \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-calculus.},

To remedy the situation, this paper develops a general and formal theory of bidirectional typing for simply typed languages: for every signature that specifies a mode-correct bidirectionally typed language, there exists a proof-relevant type synthesiser which, given an input abstract syntax tree, constructs a typing derivation if any, gives its refutation if not, or reports that the input does not have enough type annotations. Sufficient conditions for deriving a type synthesiser such as soundness, completeness, and mode-correctness are studied universally for all signatures. We propose a preprocessing step called mode decoration, which helps the user to deal with missing type annotations. The entire theory is formally implemented in Agda, so we provide a verified generator of proof-relevant type synthesisers as a by-product of our formalism.},

  abstract = {The field of artificial intelligence represents a frontier and a focal point of contemporary technological development. As an important embodiment of artificial intelligence applied to theoretical-level research, mechanical proving has been a subject of significant interest among researchers. The past few centuries have witnessed multiple periods of machine proof of mathematical theorems as computer technology has continued to evolve. From the initial proposal of ``mechanization of human mental labor'' being proposed to the present, the idea of ``mechanization of mathematics'' has been gradually being realized. Along with various formalization tools being developed, mechanical proving have ushered in a new era nowadays. This paper introduces and summarizes the history of mathematical formalization, the main formalization tools and the main theoretical achievements in different stages and fields. This paper also provides an overview of our group's work in the formalization of a series of mathematical theorems using Coq, including Morse-Kelly axiomatic set theory and the foundations of analysis among others. Despite the considerable promise of formal tools in bolstering system reliability and mathematical rigorousness, it continues to encounter obstacles in practical applications. Although the formal tool holds considerable prospects in enhancing system reliability and mathematical rigorousness, it still meets with barriers in practical application. The paper concludes with a discussion of some of the current challenges associated with mechanical proving, as well as offers suggestions for future research directions.},

Unlike HOAS, PHOAS types are definable in general-purpose type theories that support traditional functional programming, like Coq's Calculus of Inductive Constructions. We walk through how Coq can be used to develop certified, executable program transformations over several statically-typed functional programming languages formalized with PHOAS; that is, each transformation has a machine-checked proof of type preservation and semantic preservation. Our examples include CPS translation and closure conversion for simply-typed lambda calculus, CPS translation for System F, and translation from a language with ML-style pattern matching to a simpler language with no variable-arity binding constructs. By avoiding the syntactic hassle associated with first-order representation techniques, we achieve a very high degree of proof automation.},

After recalling basic structural properties of the free commutative-monoid construction, we formalise and establish the categorical universal property of two, necessarily equivalent, algebraic presentations of free commutative monoids using 1-HITs. These presentations correspond to two different equational theories invariably including commutation axioms. In this setting, we prove important structural combinatorial properties of finite multisets. These properties are established in full generality without assuming decidable equality on the carrier set. As an application, we present a constructive formalisation of the relational model of classical linear logic and its differential structure. This leads to constructively establishing that free commutative monoids are conical refinement monoids. Thereon we obtain a characterisation of the equality type of finite multisets and a new presentation of the free commutative-monoid construction as a set-quotient of the list construction. These developments crucially rely on the commutation relation of creation/annihilation operators associated with the free commutative-monoid construction seen as a combinatorial Fock space.},

  abstract = {Background. Endowing intelligent systems with semantic data commonly requires designing and instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge. Especially in the early phases, those activities are typically performed manually by human experts possibly leveraging on their own experience. The resulting process is therefore time-consuming, error-prone, and often biased by the personal background of the ontology designer. Objective. To mitigate that issue, we propose a novel domain-independent approach to automatically instantiate ontologies with domain-specific knowledge, by leveraging on large language models (LLMs) as oracles. Method. Starting from (i) an initial schema composed by inter-related classes andproperties and (ii) a set of query templates, our method queries the LLM multi- ple times, and generates instances for both classes and properties from its replies. Thus, the ontology is automatically filled with domain-specific knowledge, compliant to the initial schema. As a result, the ontology is quickly and automatically enriched with manifold instances, which experts may consider to keep, adjust, discard, or complement according to their own needs and expertise. Contribution. We formalise our method in general way and instantiate it over various LLMs, as well as on a concrete case study. We report experiments rooted in the nutritional domain where an ontology of food meals and their ingredients is semi-automatically instantiated from scratch, starting from a categorisation of meals and their relationships. There, we analyse the quality of the generated ontologies and compare ontologies attained by exploiting different LLMs. Finally, we provide a SWOT analysis of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {We present a novel characterization of stable mergesort functions using relational parametricity, and show that it implies the correctness of mergesort. As a result, one can prove the correctness of several variations of mergesort (e.g., top-down, bottom-up, tail-recursive, non-tail-recursive, smooth, and non-smooth mergesorts) by proving the characterization property for each variation. To further motivate this work, we show a performance trade-off between tail-recursive and non-tail-recursive mergesorts that (1) the former in call-by-value evaluation avoids using up stack space and is efficient and (2) the latter in call-by-need evaluation is an optimal incremental sort, meaning that it performs only \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(n + k {\textbackslash}log k)\$ comparisons to compute the least (or greatest) \$k\$ items of a list of length \$n\$. Thanks to our characterization and the parametricity translation, we deduced the correctness results, including stability, of various implementations of mergesort for lists, including highly optimized ones, in the Coq proof assistant.},

A Kripke semantics is developed for minimal logic and its sublogics with a still weaker negation by introducing a function on the upward closed sets of the models. The basic logic is a logic in which the negation has no properties but the one of being a unary operator. A number of extensions is studied of which the most important ones are contraposition logic and negative ex falso, a weak form of the ex falso principle. Completeness is proved and the created semantics is further studied. The negative translation of classical logic into intutionistic logic is made part of a chain of translations by introducing translations from minimal logic into contraposition logic and intuitionistic logic into minimal logic, the latter having been discovered in the correspondence between Johansson and Heyting. Finally, as a bridge to the work of Franco Montagna a start is made of a study of linear models of these logics.},

Intuitionistic rules apparently do not capture interesting meta-properties of the logic and, from a computational perspective, the programs corresponding to intuitionistic proofs are not powerful enough. Such non-provable implications are nevertheless admissible, and we study their behavior by means of a proof term assignment and related rules of reduction. We introduce V, a calculus that is able to represent admissible inferences, while remaining in the intuitionistic world by having normal forms that are just intuitionistic terms. We then extend intuitionistic logic with principles corresponding to admissible rules. As an example, we consider the Kreisel-Putnam logic KP, for which we prove the strong normalization and the disjunction property through our term assignment. This is our first step in understanding the essence of admissible rules for intuitionistic logic.},

MF serves as a common core among the most relevant foundations for mathematics in the literature by choosing for each of them the appropriate level of MF to be translated in a compatible way, namely by preserving the meaning of logical and set-theoretical constructors. The two-level structure consists of an intensional level, an extensional one, and an interpretation of the latter in the former in order to extract intensional computational contents from mathematical proofs involving extensional constructions used in everyday mathematical practice. In 2013 a completely new foundation for constructive mathematics appeared in the literature, called Homotopy Type Theory, for short HoTT, which is an example of Voevodsky's Univalent Foundations with a computational nature. So far no level of MF has been proved to be compatible with any of the Univalent Foundations in the literature. Here we show that both levels of MF are compatible with HoTT. This result is made possible thanks to the peculiarities of HoTT which combines intensional features of type theory with extensional ones by assuming Voevodsky's Univalence Axiom and higher inductive quotient types. As a relevant consequence, MF inherits entirely new computable models.},

  abstract = {Natural deduction (ND) for first order classical logic is obtainable from the intuitionist system by the addition of Peirce rule. In a previous paper [Luiz Carlos Pereira, Edward Hermann Haeusler, Vaston G. Costa, and Wagner Sanz. Normalization for the implicational fragment of classical propositional logic. Submited to a Journal, 2008], it was presented a normalization strategy for the implicational fragment with Pierce rule. The end normal form is divided in two parts: an intuitionist subdeduction followed by a series of Peirce rule applications, maybe empty. Here, we extend this normalization process to the system for first order classical logic NP system. NP normal derivations also present the same structure. This structure is the basis on which many properties for ND derivations can be presented. In particular, we present a form of Glivenko's theorem for the conjunction-implication fragment. Unfortunately, NP lacks strong normalization, although ND with classical absurdity rule doesn't lack it, as it's well-known.},

The form of HOAS provided by               Hybrid               is essentially a lambda calculus with constants.                                         Of fundamental interest is the form of the lambda abstractions provided by               Hybrid               . The user has the convenience of writing lambda abstractions using names for the binding variables. However, each abstraction is actually a               definition               of a de Bruijn expression, and               Hybrid               can unwind the user's abstractions (written with names) to machine friendly de Bruijn expressions (without names). In this sense the formal system contains a               hybrid               of named and nameless bound variable notation.                                         In this paper, we present a formal theory in a logical framework, which can be viewed as a model of core               Hybrid               , and state and prove that the model is representationally adequate for HOAS. In particular, it is the canonical translation function from {$\lambda$}-expressions to               Hybrid               that witnesses adequacy. We also prove two results that characterise how               Hybrid               represents certain classes of {$\lambda$}-expression.                                         We provide the first detailed proof to be published that proper locally nameless de Bruijn expressions and {$\alpha$}-equivalence classes of {$\lambda$}-expressions are in bijective correspondence. This result is presented as a form of de Bruijn representational adequacy, and is a key component of the proof of               Hybrid               adequacy.                                         The               Hybrid               system contains a number of different syntactic classes of expression, and associated abstraction mechanisms. Hence, this paper also aims to provide a self-contained theoretical introduction to both the syntax and key ideas of the system. Although this paper will be of considerable interest to those who wish to work with               Hybrid               in Isabelle/HOL, a background in automated theorem proving is not essential.},

We present ongoing work on a logical framework with a meta-language based on graphs. A simpler meta-language leads to a shallower embedding of the object language, but hopefully leads to easier implementation and usage. A graph-based logical framework also opens up interesting possibilities in time and space performance by using heavily optimized graph databases as backends and by proof compression algorithms geared towards graphs. Deductive systems can be specified using simple domain-specific languages built on top of the graph database's query language. There is support for interactive (through a web-based interface) and semiautomatic (following user-defined tactics specified by a domain-specific language) proof modes. We have so far implemented nine systems for propositional logic, including Fitch-style and backward-directed Natural Deduction systems for intuitionistic and classical logic (with the classical systems reusing the rules of the intuitionistic ones), and a Hilbert-style system for the K modal logic.},

  abstract = {For those of us who generally live in the world of syntax, semantic proof techniques such as reducibility, realizability or logical relations seem somewhat magical despite -- or perhaps due to -- their seemingly unreasonable effectiveness. Why do they work? At which point in the proof is "the real work" done? Hoping to build a programming intuition of these proofs, we implement a normalization argument for the simply-typed lambda-calculus with sums: instead of a proof, it is described as a program in a dependently-typed meta-language. The semantic technique we set out to study is Krivine's classical realizability, which amounts to a proof-relevant presentation of reducibility arguments -- unary logical relations. Reducibility assigns a predicate to each type, realizability assigns a set of realizers, which are abstract machines that extend lambda-terms with a first-class notion of contexts. Normalization is a direct consequence of an adequacy theorem or "fundamental lemma", which states that any well-typed term translates to a realizer of its type. We show that the adequacy theorem, when written as a dependent program, corresponds to an evaluation procedure. In particular, a weak normalization proof precisely computes a series of reduction from the input term to a normal form. Interestingly, the choices that we make when we define the reducibility predicates -- truth and falsity witnesses for each connective -- determine the evaluation order of the proof, with each datatype constructor behaving in a lazy or strict fashion. While most of the ideas in this presentation are folklore among specialists, our dependently-typed functional program provides an accessible presentation to a wider audience. In particular, our work provides a gentle introduction to abstract machine calculi which have recently been used as an effective research vehicle.},

  abstract = {We derive an intuitionistic version of G{\"o}del-L{\"o}b modal logic (GL) in the style of Simpson, via proof theoretic techniques. We recover a labelled system, {$\ell$}IGL, by restricting a non-wellfounded labelled system for GL to have only one formula on the right. The latter is obtained using techniques from cyclic proof theory, sidestepping the barrier that GL's usual frame condition (converse wellfoundedness) is not first-order definable. While existing intuitionistic versions of GL are typically defined over only the box (and not the diamond), our presentation includes both modalities. Our main result is that {$\ell$}IGL coincides with a corresponding semantic condition in birelational semantics: the composition of the modal relation and the intuitionistic relation is conversely wellfounded. We call the resulting logic IGL. While the soundness direction is proved using standard ideas, the completeness direction is more complex and necessitates a detour through several intermediate characterisations of IGL.},

Other algorithms produce either an answer or a proof that no such answer exists. It may still be easy to verify that the answer is correct, but what about the ``no such answer'' case. The claim of this paper is that, at least in some cases, it is possible for the algorithm to produce ``hints'' such that a theorem prover can prove that, in this case, there is no such answer. This leads to the paradigm of ``ad hoc UNSAT verification''.},

DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.},

First, we formalize the general abstract notions of divisibility, prime, and irreducible elements in commutative rings, essential to deal with unique factorization domains. Then, we formalize the landmark theorem, establishing that every principal ideal domain is a unique factorization domain. Finally, we specify the theory of Euclidean domains and formally verify that the rings of integers, the Gaussian integers, and arbitrary fields are Euclidean domains. To highlight the benefits of such a general abstract discipline of formalization, we specify a Euclidean gcd algorithm for Euclidean domains and formalize its correctness. Also, we show how this correctness is inherited under adequate parameterizations for the structures of integers and Gaussian integers.},

  abstract = {Turing machines and register machines have been used for decades in theoretical computer science as abstract models of computation. Also the \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-calculus has played a central role in this domain as it allows to focus on the notion of functional computation, based on the substitution mechanism, while abstracting away from implementation details. The present article starts from the observation that the equivalence between these formalisms is based on the Church-Turing Thesis rather than an actual encoding of \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-terms into Turing (or register) machines. The reason is that these machines are not well-suited for modelling {\textbackslash}lam-calculus programs. We study a class of abstract machines that we call {\textbackslash}emph\{addressing machine\} since they are only able to manipulate memory addresses of other machines. The operations performed by these machines are very elementary: load an address in a register, apply a machine to another one via their addresses, and call the address of another machine. We endow addressing machines with an operational semantics based on leftmost reduction and study their behaviour. The set of addresses of these machines can be easily turned into a combinatory algebra. In order to obtain a model of the full untyped \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-calculus, we need to introduce a rule that bares similarities with the \${\textbackslash}omega\$-rule and the rule \${\textbackslash}zeta\_{\textbackslash}beta\$ from combinatory logic.},

Our review of background and survey of algorithmic results are by no means complete, but should serve as a useful primer.},

These equations find wide applications in the design and analysis of various systems, including integrated circuits and antennas. This paper proposes the utilization of higher-order-logic theorem proving for a formal analysis of the telegrapher's equations, also referred to as the transmission line equations. Specifically, we present a formal model of the telegrapher's equations in both time and phasor domains. Subsequently, we employ the HOL Light theorem prover to formally verify the solutions of the telegrapher's equations in the phasor domain. Furthermore, we established a connection between phasor and time-domain functions to formally verify the general solutions for the time-domain partial differential equations for the current and voltage in an electric transmission line. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed formalization, we conduct a formal analysis of a terminated transmission line and its special cases, i.e., short-and open-circuited transmission lines commonly used in antenna design, by formally verifying the load impedance and the voltage reflection coefficient.},

We show that the work of Kolmogorov can be regarded as a bridge between Veloso's abstract notion of a problem and the conceptual problems Blass discussed in his questions-and-answers framework. This bridge can be seen by means of the categorical Dialectica constructions introduced in de Paiva's dissertation and reformulated by da Silva to account for set-theoretical foundational assumptions. The use of categorical concepts allows us to provide several examples, connecting extremely different areas of mathematics, and using simple methods. This paper also shows that while Blass and Kolmogorov notions of problem can be investigated using the Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set-theoretical framework, Veloso problems require the Axiom of Choice (AC). Moreover, weaker notions of choice (dependent choice and countable choice) can also be accounted for in the problems' framework.},

The usage of mathematical induction often involves wider set of base cases and k-ary generating functions with different structural restrictions. While subsequent studies have shown several Induction Models to be equivalent, there does not exist precise logical characterization of reduction and equivalence among different Induction Models. In this paper, we generalize the definition of Induction Model and demonstrate existence and construction of S for given B and vice versa. We then provide a formal characterization of the reduction among different Induction Models that can allow proofs in one Induction Models to be expressed as proofs in another Induction Models.

  abstract = {We introduce the flower calculus, a deep inference proof system for intuitionistic first-order logic inspired by Peirce's existential graphs. It works as a rewriting system over inductive objects called ``flowers'', that enjoy both a graphical interpretation as topological diagrams, and a textual presentation as nested sequents akin to coherent formulas. Importantly, the calculus dispenses completely with the traditional notion of symbolic connective, operating solely on nested flowers containing atomic predicates. We prove both the soundness of the full calculus and the completeness of an analytic fragment with respect to Kripke semantics. This provides to our knowledge the first analyticity result for a proof system based on existential graphs, adapting semantic cut-elimination techniques to a deep inference setting. Furthermore, the kernel of rules targetted by completeness is fully invertible, a desirable property for both automated and interactive proof search.},

In PNL, the forall-quantifier or lambda-binder are just term-formers satisfying axioms, and their denotation is functions on nominal atoms-abstraction. Then we have higher-order logic (HOL) and its models in ordinary (i.e. Zermelo-Fraenkel) sets; the denotation of forall or lambda is functions on full or partial function spaces. This raises the following question: how are these two models of binding connected? What translation is possible between PNL and HOL, and between nominal sets and functions? We exhibit a translation of PNL into HOL, and from models of PNL to certain models of HOL. It is natural, but also partial: we translate a restricted subsystem of full PNL to HOL. The extra part which does not translate is the symmetry properties of nominal sets with respect to permutations. To use a little nominal jargon: we can translate names and binding, but not their nominal equivariance properties. This seems reasonable since HOL -- and ordinary sets -- are not equivariant. Thus viewed through this translation, PNL and HOL and their models do different things, but they enjoy non-trivial and rich subsystems which are isomorphic.},

  abstract = {We present a model of computation that heavily emphasizes the concept of duality and the interaction between opposites---production interacts with consumption. The symmetry of this framework naturally explains more complicated features of programming languages through relatively familiar concepts. For example, binding a value to a variable is dual to manipulating the flow of control in a program. By looking at the computational interpretation of the sequent calculus, we find a language that lets us speak about duality, control flow, and evaluation order in programs as first-class concepts. We begin by reviewing Gentzen's LK sequent calculus and show how the Curry-Howard isomorphism still applies to give us a different basis for expressing computation. We then illustrate how the fundamental dilemma of computation in the sequent calculus gives rise to a duality between evaluation strategies: strict languages are dual to lazy languages. Finally, we discuss how the concept of focusing, developed in the setting of proof search, is related to the idea of type safety for computation expressed in the sequent calculus. In this regard, we compare and contrast two different methods of focusing that have appeared in the literature, static and dynamic focusing, and illustrate how they are two means to the same end.},

However the program may be seen as rather tricky and one may be not convinced about its correctness. This paper explains the program in a declarative way, and provides proofs of its correctness and completeness. The specification and the proofs are declarative, i.e. they abstract from any operational semantics. The specification is approximate, it is unnecessary to describe the program's semantics exactly. Despite the program works on non-ground terms, this work employs the standard semantics, based on Herbrand interpretations and logical consequence. Another purpose of the paper is to present an example of precise declarative reasoning about the semantics of a logic program.}

For typability Wells developed an intricate calculus to control the shape of type assumptions across type derivations via term structure.

But in systems with induction rules, cut-elimination is either impossible or does not produce proofs with the subformula property. One way to overcome this problem is to formulate induction proofs as infinite sequences of proofs in a uniform way and to develop a method, which yields a uniform description of the corresponding cut-free proofs. We present such a formalism, as an alternative to systems with induction rules, and define a corresponding cut-elimination method (based on the CERES-method for first-order logic). The basic tools of proof theory, such as sequent- and resolution calculi are enriched with inductive definitions and schemata of terms, formulas, proofs, etc. We define a class of inductive proofs which can be transformed into this formalism and subjected to schematic cut-elimination.},

Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their alignment with LLM capabilities, integrating both human expertise and GPT-4 classifications. Our findings reveal that around 80\% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10\% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19\% of workers may see at least 50\% of their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities and LLM-powered software. Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM, about 15\% of all worker tasks in the US could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47 and 56\% of all tasks. This finding implies that LLM-powered software will have a substantial effect on scaling the economic impacts of the underlying models. We conclude that LLMs such as GPTs exhibit traits of general-purpose technologies, indicating that they could have considerable economic, social, and policy implications.},

  abstract = {Like termination, confluence is a central property of rewrite systems. Unlike for termination, however, there exists no known complexity hierarchy for confluence. In this paper we investigate whether the decreasing diagrams technique can be used to obtain such a hierarchy. The decreasing diagrams technique is one of the strongest and most versatile methods for proving confluence of abstract rewrite systems. It is complete for countable systems, and it has many well-known confluence criteria as corollaries. So what makes decreasing diagrams so powerful? In contrast to other confluence techniques, decreasing diagrams employ a labelling of the steps with labels from a well-founded order in order to conclude confluence of the underlying unlabelled relation. Hence it is natural to ask how the size of the label set influences the strength of the technique. In particular, what class of abstract rewrite systems can be proven confluent using decreasing diagrams restricted to 1 label, 2 labels, 3 labels, and so on? Surprisingly, we find that two labels suffice for proving confluence for every abstract rewrite system having the cofinality property, thus in particular for every confluent, countable system. Secondly, we show that this result stands in sharp contrast to the situation for commutation of rewrite relations, where the hierarchy does not collapse. Thirdly, investigating the possibility of a confluence hierarchy, we determine the first-order (non-)definability of the notion of confluence and related properties, using techniques from finite model theory. We find that in particular Hanf's theorem is fruitful for elegant proofs of undefinability of properties of abstract rewrite systems.}

Agda allows us to write mathematical definitions, constructions, theorems and proofs, for example in number theory, analysis, group theory, topology, category theory or programming language theory, checking them for logical and mathematical correctness. Agda is a constructive mathematical system by default, which amounts to saying that it can also be considered as a programming language for manipulating mathematical objects. But we can assume the axiom of choice or the principle of excluded middle for pieces of mathematics that require them, at the cost of losing the implicit programming-language character of the system. For a fully constructive development of univalent mathematics in Agda, we would need to use its new cubical flavour, and we hope these notes provide a base for researchers interested in learning cubical type theory and cubical Agda as the next step. Compared to most expositions of the subject, we work with explicit universe levels.},

Proving interesting properties for each one of them supposes a big workload for logicians and computer scientists. We want an approach into this problematic that is modular. To adress this issue, the report shows new insights in the construction of Atomic Logics introduced by Guillaume Aucher. Atomic Logics let us represent very general left and right introduction rules and they come along a new kind of rules based on display logics and residuation. A new approach is taken into the definition of Atomic Logics, which is now built on a class of actions for which we prove cut-elimination. We show that some of them are equivalent to Aucher's Atomic Logics and we prove cut-elimination and Craig Interpolation for a class of them. The introduced theory is applied to the non-associative Lambek Calculus throughout the report. It is accompanied by a computer-checked formalisation of the original syntax in the proof assistant Coq.},

What is co-control and a co-continuation? How to define the dual of Parigot's mu-operator so that it is a co-control operator? Answering these questions leads to the interpretation that sequent calculus is a formal vector notation with first-class co-control. But this is just the "internal" interpretation, which has to be developed simultaneously with, and is justified by, an equivalent, "external" interpretation, offered by natural deduction: the sequent calculus corresponds to a bi-directional, agnostic (w.r.t. the call strategy), computational lambda-calculus. Next, the formal duality between control and co-control is studied, in the context of classical logic. The duality cannot be observed in the sequent calculus, but rather in a system unifying sequent calculus and natural deduction.},

This approach works by exploiting a representation of the search space generated by a given inhabitation problem, which is in terms of a lambda-calculus for proof search that the authors developed recently. The representation may be seen as extending the Curry-Howard representation of proofs by lambda terms. Our methodology reveals inductive descriptions of the decision problems, driven by the syntax of the proof-search expressions, and produces simple, recursive decision procedures and counting functions. These allow to predict the number of inhabitants by testing the given type for syntactic criteria. This new approach is comprehensive and robust: based on the same syntactic representation, we also derive the state-of-the-art coherence theorems ensuring uniqueness of inhabitants.},

  abstract = {The campaign to transform traditional mathematical practice into a formal discipline appears to have been a great success. Several sophisticated proof assistants have been developed, a great deal of mathematical knowledge has been formalized, a growing number of researchers in computing and mathematics are now using proof assistants to check the theorems they prove, and a new area of computing called formal methods has been established in which formal mathematics is used in the development of hardware and software. However, the campaign has largely been a failure when viewed from a broader perspective. It has had almost no impact on mathematical practice. Far less than 1\% of all mathematics practitioners have ever used a formal logic or a proof assistant in their work. We propose an alternative approach to formal mathematics that is characterized by (1) proofs are written in a traditional (informal) style, (2) the underlying logic is as close to mathematical practice as possible, (3) mathematics is organized in accordance with the little theories method as a theory graph, and (4) supporting software systems are easy to build and use. We are pursuing a research program called Formal Mathematics for the Masses to make formal mathematics more useful, accessible, and natural to a wider range of mathematics practitioners by implementing this alternative approach.},

  abstract = {As the development of formal proofs is a time-consuming task, it is important to devise ways of sharing the already written proofs to prevent wasting time redoing them. One of the challenges in this domain is to translate proofs written in proof assistants based on impredicative logics to proof assistants based on predicative logics, whenever impredicativity is not used in an essential way. In this paper we present a transformation for sharing proofs with a core predicative system supporting prenex universe polymorphism (like in Agda). It consists in trying to elaborate a potentially impredicative term into a predicative universe polymorphic term as general as possible. The use of universe polymorphism is justified by the fact that mapping each universe to a fixed one in the target theory is not sufficient in most cases. During the algorithm, we need to solve unification problems in the equational theory of universe levels. In order to do this, we give a complete characterization of when a single equation admits a most general unifier. This characterization is then employed in an algorithm which uses a constraint-postponement strategy to solve unification problems. The proposed translation is of course partial, but in practice allows one to translate many proofs that do not use impredicativity in an essential way. Indeed, it was implemented in the tool Predicativize and then used to translate semi-automatically many non-trivial developments from Matita's arithmetic library to Agda, including proofs of Bertrand's Postulate and Fermat's Little Theorem, which (as far as we know) were not available in Agda yet.},

Existing developments offer some relief, however at the expense of inconvenient and error-prone term encodings and lack of formal foundations. We present a mathematically-inspired language-formalisation framework implemented in Agda. The system translates the description of a syntax signature with variable-binding operators into an intrinsicallyencoded, inductive data type equipped with syntactic operations such as weakening and substitution, along with their correctness properties. The generated metatheory further incorporates metavariables and their associated operation of metasubstitution, which enables second-order equational/rewriting reasoning. The underlying mathematical foundation of the framework -- initial algebra semantics -- derives compositional interpretations of languages into their models satisfying the semantic substitution lemma by construction.

We do so by constructing QWI types as colimits of a family of approximations to them defined by well-founded recursion over a suitable notion of size, whose definition involves the WISC axiom.

In the second part of the paper the analysis is refined further by considering intensional Kripke relations (in the form of Artin glueing) and shown to provide a function for normalising terms, casting normalisation by evaluation in the context of categorical glueing. The technical development includes an algebraic treatment of the syntax and semantics of the typed lambda calculus that allows the definition of the normalisation function to be given within a simply typed metatheory. A normalisation-by-evaluation program in a dependently-typed functional programming language is synthesised.},

  abstract = {Over the last decades, deep neural networks based-models became the dominant paradigm in machine learning. Further, the use of artificial neural networks in symbolic learning has been seen as increasingly relevant recently. To study the capabilities of neural networks in the symbolic AI domain, researchers have explored the ability of deep neural networks to learn mathematical constructions, such as addition and multiplication, logic inference, such as theorem provers, and even the execution of computer programs. The latter is known to be too complex a task for neural networks. Therefore, the results were not always successful, and often required the introduction of biased elements in the learning process, in addition to restricting the scope of possible programs to be executed. In this work, we will analyze the ability of neural networks to learn how to execute programs as a whole. To do so, we propose a different approach. Instead of using an imperative programming language, with complex structures, we use the Lambda Calculus ({$\lambda$}-Calculus), a simple, but Turing-Complete mathematical formalism, which serves as the basis for modern functional programming languages and is at the heart of computability theory. We will introduce the use of integrated neural learning and lambda calculi formalization. Finally, we explore execution of a program in {$\lambda$}-Calculus is based on reductions, we will show that it is enough to learn how to perform these reductions so that we can execute any program.},

The main subtlety lies in proving AB4, which is that coproducts indexed by arbitrary sets are left-exact. To prove this, we replace a set with its strict category of (ordered) finite sub-multisets. From showing that the latter is filtered, we deduce left-exactness of the coproduct. More generally, we show that exactness of filtered colimits (AB5) implies AB4 for any abelian category in HoTT. Our approach is heavily inspired by Roswitha Harting's construction of the internal coproduct of abelian groups in an elementary topos with a natural numbers object [Har82].},

Recently, \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{CT\}\$ was proved consistent for (univalent) constructive type theory. Since neither Weak K{\textbackslash}"onig's Lemma nor the fan theorem are a consequence of just logical axioms or just choice-like axioms assumed in constructive logic, it seems likely that \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{CT\}\$ is only inconsistent with a combination of classical logic and choice axioms. We study consequences of \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{CT\}\$ and its relation to several classes of axioms in Coq's type theory, a constructive type theory with a universe of propositions which does neither prove classical logical axioms nor strong choice axioms. We thereby provide a partial answer to the question which axioms may preserve computational intuitions inherent to type theory, and which certainly do not. The paper can also be read as a broad survey of axioms in type theory, with all results mechanised in the Coq proof assistant.},

We give a partial answer to this question contributing an assumption-free proof of CB restricted to enumerable discrete types, i.e. types which can be computationally treated. In fact, we construct several bijections from injections: The first is by translating a proof of the Myhill isomorphism theorem from computability theory -- stating that 1-equivalent predicates are recursively isomorphic -- to constructive type theory, where the bijection is constructed in stages and an algorithm with an intricate termination argument is used to extend the bijection in every step. The second is also constructed in stages, but with a simpler extension algorithm sufficient for CB. The third is constructed directly in such a way that it only relies on the given enumerations of the types, not on the given injections. We aim at keeping the explanations simple, accessible, and concise in the style of a ``proof pearl''. All proofs are machine-checked in Coq but should transport to other foundations -- they do not rely on impredicativity, on choice principles, or on large eliminations.},

  abstract = {The Kleene-Post theorem and Post's theorem are two central and historically important results in the development of oracle computability theory, clarifying the structure of Turing reducibility degrees. They state, respectively, that there are incomparable Turing degrees and that the arithmetical hierarchy is connected to the relativised form of the halting problem defined via Turing jumps. We study these two results in the calculus of inductive constructions (CIC), the constructive type theory underlying the Coq proof assistant. CIC constitutes an ideal foundation for the formalisation of computability theory for two reasons: First, like in other constructive foundations, computable functions can be treated via axioms as a purely synthetic notion rather than being defined in terms of a concrete analytic model of computation such as Turing machines. Furthermore and uniquely, CIC allows consistently assuming classical logic via the law of excluded middle or weaker variants on top of axioms for synthetic computability, enabling both fully classical developments and taking the perspective of constructive reverse mathematics on computability theory.},

We present soundness and completeness proofs of a sequent calculus for first-order logic, formalized in the interactive proof assistant Isabelle/HOL. Our formalization is based on work by Stefan Berghofer, which we have since updated to use Isabelle's declarative proof style Isar (Archive of Formal Proofs, Entry FOL-Fitting, August 2007 / July 2018). We represent variables with de Bruijn indices; this makes substitution under quantifiers less intuitive for a human reader. However, the nature of natural numbers yields an elegant solution when compared to implementations of substitution using variables represented by strings. The sequent calculus considered has the special property of an always empty antecedent and a list of formulas in the succedent. We obtain the proofs of soundness and completeness for the sequent calculus as a derived result of the inverse duality of its tableau counterpart. We strive to not only present the results of the proofs of soundness and completeness, but also to provide a deep dive into a programming-like approach to the formalization of first-order logic syntax, semantics and the sequent calculus. We use the formalization in a bachelor course on logic for computer science and discuss our experiences.},

While the Girard translation from intuitionistic logic to linear logic is well-known, its extension to modal logic is non-trivial since a naive combination of the S4 modality and the exponential modality causes an undesirable interaction between the two modalities. To solve the problem, we introduce an extension of intuitionistic multiplicative exponential linear logic with a modality combining the S4 modality and the exponential modality, and show that it admits a sound translation from IS4. Through the Curry-Howard correspondence we further obtain a Geometry of Interaction Machine semantics of the modal lambda-calculus by Pfenning and Davies for staged computation.}

Is substitution something that we define on syntax on a case-by-case basis, or can we turn the idea of substitution into a mathematical object? We give axioms for substitution and prove them sound and complete with respect to a canonical model. As corollaries we obtain a useful conservativity result, and prove that equality-up-to-substitution is a decidable relation on terms. These results involve subtle use of techniques both from rewriting and algebra. A special feature of our method is the use of nominal techniques. These give us access to a stronger assertion language, which includes so-called `freshness' or `capture-avoidance' conditions. This means that the sense in which we axiomatise substitution (and prove soundness and completeness) is particularly strong, while remaining quite general.},

The permutation model of set theory with atoms (FM-sets), devised by Fraenkel and Mostowski in the 1930s, supports notions of `name-abstraction' and `fresh name' that provide a new way to represent, compute with, and reason about the syntax of formal systems involving variable-binding operations. Inductively defined FM-sets involving the name-abstraction set former (together with Cartesian product and disjoint union) can correctly encode syntax modulo renaming of bound variables. In this way, the standard theory of algebraic data types can be extended to encompass signatures involving binding operators. In particular, there is an associated notion of structural recursion for defining syntax-manipulating functions (such as capture avoiding substitution, set of free variables, etc.) and a notion of proof by structural induction, both of which remain pleasingly close to informal practice in computer science.},

Recent research in proof theory has identified two features that facilitate direct, logic-based reasoning about such descriptions: the interpretation of atomic judgments through recursive definitions and an encoding of binding constructs via generic judgments. However, logics encompassing these two features do not currently allow for the definition of relations that embody dynamic aspects related to binding, a capability needed in many reasoning tasks. We propose a new relation between terms called nominal abstraction as a means for overcoming this deficiency. We incorporate nominal abstraction into a rich logic also including definitions, generic quantification, induction, and co-induction that we then prove to be consistent. We present examples to show that this logic can provide elegant treatments of binding contexts that appear in many proofs, such as those establishing properties of typing calculi and of arbitrarily cascading substitutions that play a role in reducibility arguments.},

One of its contributions is the simplification and rationalization of the suspension calculus that embodies such a treatment. The earlier version of this calculus provides a cumbersome encoding of substitution composition, an operation that is important to the efficient realization of reduction. This encoding is simplified here, resulting in a treatment that is easy to use directly in applications. The rationalization consists of the elimination of a practically inconsequential flexibility in the unravelling of substitutions that has the inadvertent side effect of losing contextual information in terms; the modified calculus now has a structure that naturally supports logical analyses, such as ones related to the assignment of types, over lambda terms. The overall calculus is shown to have pleasing theoretical properties such as a strongly terminating sub-calculus for substitution and confluence even in the presence of term meta variables that are accorded a grafting interpretation. Another contribution of the paper is the identification of a broad set of properties that are desirable for explicit substitution calculi to support and a classification of a variety of proposed systems based on these. The suspension calculus is used as a tool in this study. In particular, mappings are described between it and the other calculi towards understanding the characteristics of the latter.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Gazzari provides a mathematical theory of occurrences and of substitutions, which are a generalisation of occurrences constituting substitution functions. The dissertation focusses on term occurrences in terms of a first order language, but the methods and results obtained there can easily be carried over to arbitrary kinds of occurrences in arbitrary kinds of languages.             The aim of the dissertation is twofold: first, Gazzari intends to provide an adequate formal representation of philosophically relevant concepts (not only of occurrences and substitutions, but also of substitution functions, of calculations as well as of intuitively given properties of the discussed entities) and to improve this way our understanding of these concepts; second, he intends to provide a formal exploration of the introduced concepts including the detailed development of the methods needed for their adequate treatment.             The dissertation serves as a methodological fundament for consecutive research on topics demanding a precise treatment of occurrences and as a foundation for all scientific work dealing with occurrences only informally; the formal investigations are complemented by a brief survey of the development of the notion of occurrences in mathematics, philosophy and computer science.                            The notion of occurrences.               Occurrences are determined by three aspects: an occurrence is always an occurrence               of               a syntactic entity (its               shape               )               in               a syntactic entity (its               context               )               at               a specific               position               . Context and shape can be any meaningful combination of well-known syntactic entities as, in logic, terms, formulae or formula trees. Gazzari's crucial idea is to represent the position of occurrences by               nominal forms               , essentially as introduced by Sch{\"u}tte [2]. The nominal forms are a generalisation of standard syntactic entities in which so called               nominal symbols                                                                      \$*\_k\$                                               may occur. The position of an occurrence is obtained by eliminating the intended shape in the context, which means to replace the intended shape by suitable nominal symbols.

Multi-shape occurrences.               The               multi-shape occurrences                                                                      \${\textbackslash}mathfrak \{o\}={\textbackslash}langle \{t,{\textbackslash}vec s,{\textbackslash}mathtt \{t\}\} {\textbackslash}rangle \$                                               are the generalisation of standard occurrences, where the shape                                                                      \${\textbackslash}vec s\$                                               is a sequence of standard terms. Such occurrences subsume arbitrary non-overlapping single occurrences in the context               t               .                          Gazzari addresses the non-trivial identity of such occurrences and their independence. The latter represents formally the idea of non-overlapping occurrences and is a far-reaching generalisation of disjointness as discussed by Huet with respect to single occurrences. Independent occurrences can be merged into one occurrence; an occurrence can be split up into independent occurrences.                            Substitutions.               A substitution                                                                      \${\textbackslash}mathbf s={\textbackslash}langle \{t,{\textbackslash}vec s,{\textbackslash}mathtt \{t\},\{{\textbackslash}vec s\}',t'\} {\textbackslash}rangle \$                                               satisfies that both                                                                      \${\textbackslash}mathfrak \{o\}={\textbackslash}langle \{t,{\textbackslash}vec s,{\textbackslash}mathtt \{t\}\} {\textbackslash}rangle \$                                               and                                                                      \${\textbackslash}mathfrak \{o\}'={\textbackslash}langle \{t',\{{\textbackslash}vec s\}',{\textbackslash}mathtt \{t\}\} {\textbackslash}rangle \$                                               are occurrences such that the shapes have the same length. Such a substitution represents the replacement of                                                                      \${\textbackslash}vec s\$                                               in               t               at                                                                      \${\textbackslash}mathtt \{t\}\$                                               by                                                                      \${\textbackslash}vec s'\$                                               resulting in                                                                      \$t'\$                                               . This means that a substitution is understood as a process and not as a (specific type of a) function.                          Identity and independence are addressed again, using and extending the methods developed for occurrences; as before, independent substitutions can be merged and substitutions can be split up into sequences of independent substitutions. Substitutions are used to represent formally calculations (as found in everyday mathematics) and to investigate them.                            Sets of substitutions turn out to be set-theoretic functions mapping the affected occurrences                                                                      \${\textbackslash}mathfrak \{o\}\$                                               and the inserted shapes                                                                      \$\{{\textbackslash}vec s\}'\$                                               to the result                                                                      \$t'\$                                               of a substitution                                                                      \${\textbackslash}mathbf s\$                                               . Such sets are called               explicit substitution functions               . In order to qualify functions which are usually understood as substitution functions (and which are not formulated in a theory of occurrences) as substitution functions, Gazzari develops the concept of an               explication method               transforming such functions into explicit substitution functions. The appropriateness and the (philosophical) limitations of this concept are illustrated with example functions.                                         Conclusion.               Gazzari's theory of occurrences is strong (not restricted to single occurrences), canonical (nominal forms are a canonical generalisation of the underlying syntactic entities) and general (presupposing the grammar for the underlying syntactic entities, suitable nominal forms are easily defined and the theory of occurrences is immediately carried over). Another advantage is a kind of methodological pureness: positions are generalised syntactic entities (and not extraneous, as sequences of natural numbers) and can be treated, in particular, with the well-known methods developed for the underlying syntactic entities.

  abstract = {We present a first-order theorem proving framework for establishing the correctness of functional programs implementing sorting algorithms with recursive data structures. We formalize the semantics of recursive programs in many-sorted first-order logic and integrate sortedness/permutation properties within our first-order formalization. Rather than focusing on sorting lists of elements of specific first-order theories, such as integer arithmetic, our list formalization relies on a sort parameter abstracting (arithmetic) theories and hence concrete sorts. We formalize the permutation property of lists in first-order logic so that we automatically prove verification conditions of such algorithms purely by superpositon-based first-order reasoning. Doing so, we adjust recent efforts for automating inducion in saturation. We advocate a compositional approach for automating proofs by induction required to verify functional programs implementing and preserving sorting and permutation properties over parameterized list structures. Our work turns saturation-based first-order theorem proving into an automated verification engine by (i) guiding automated inductive reasoning with manual proof splits and (ii) fully automating inductive reasoning in saturation. We showcase the applicability of our framework over recursive sorting algorithms, including Mergesort and Quicksort.},

  abstract = {In earlier articles we have introduced truth table natural deduction which allows one to extract natural deduction rules for a propositional logic connective from its truth table definition. This works for both intuitionistic logic and classical logic. We have studied the proof theory of the intuitionistic rules in detail, giving rise to a general Kripke semantics and general proof term calculus with reduction rules that are strongly normalizing. In the present paper we study the classical rules and give a term interpretation to classical deductions with reduction rules. As a variation we define a multi-conclusion variant of the natural deduction rules as it simplifies the study of proof term reduction. We show that the reduction is normalizing and gives rise to the sub-formula property. We also compare the logical strength of the classical rules with the intuitionistic ones and we show that if one non-monotone connective is classical, then all connectives become classical.},

  abstract = {A bisimulation for a coalgebra of a functor on the category of sets can be described via a coalgebra in the category of relations, of a lifted functor. A final coalgebra then gives rise to the coinduction principle, which states that two bisimilar elements are equal. For polynomial functors, this leads to well-known descriptions. In the present paper we look at the dual notion of "apartness". Intuitively, two elements are apart if there is a positive way to distinguish them. Phrased differently: two elements are apart if and only if they are not bisimilar. Since apartness is an inductive notion, described by a least fixed point, one can look for proof rules. We study this in two separate ways. First, for weak forms of bisimulation on labelled transition systems, where silent (tau) steps are included, we define an apartness notion that corresponds to weak bisimulation and another apartness that corresponds to branching bisimulation. The rules for apartness can be used to show that two states of a labelled transition system are not branching bismilar. To support the apartness view on labelled transition systems, we cast a number of well-known properties of branching bisimulation in terms of branching apartness and prove them. Next, we also study the more general categorical situation and show that indeed, apartness is the dual of bisimilarity in a precise categorical sense: apartness is an initial algebra and gives rise to an induction principle. In this analogy, we include the powerset functor, which gives a semantics to non-deterministic choice in process-theory.},

Instead of solving refinement constraints with an SMT solver like DML and Liquid Haskell, our system requires and permits programmers to embed proofs of properties within the program text, letting us support a rich logic of properties including quantifiers and induction. We show that the type system is sound by showing that every refined program erases to a simply-typed program, and by means of a denotational semantics, we show that every erased program has all of the properties demanded by its refined type. All of our proofs are formalised in Lean 4.},

  abstract = {We present the design and implementation of the Small Scale Reflection proof methodology and tactic language (a.k.a. SSR) for the Lean 4 proof assistant. Like its Coq predecessor SSReflect, our Lean 4 implementation, dubbed LeanSSR, provides powerful rewriting principles and means for effective management of hypotheses in the proof context. Unlike SSReflect for Coq, LeanSSR does not require explicit switching between the logical and symbolic representation of a goal, allowing for even more concise proof scripts that seamlessly combine deduction steps with proofs by computation. In this paper, we first provide a gentle introduction to the principles of structuring mechanised proofs using LeanSSR. Next, we show how the native support for metaprogramming in Lean 4 makes it possible to develop LeanSSR entirely within the proof assistant, greatly improving the overall experience of both tactic implementers and proof engineers. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of LeanSSR by conducting two case studies: (a) porting a collection of Coq lemmas about sequences from the widely used Mathematical Components library and (b) reimplementing proofs in the finite set library of Lean's mathlib4. Both case studies show significant reduction in proof sizes.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, both scholars and practitioners have sought novel ways to address the problem of cybersecurity. Innovative outcomes have included applications such as blockchain as well as creative methods for cyber forensics, software development, and intrusion prevention. Accompanying these technological advancements, discussion on cyber matters at national and international levels has focused primarily on the topics of law, policy, and strategy. The objective of these efforts is typically to promote security by establishing agreements among stakeholders on regulatory activities. Varying levels of investment in cyberspace, however, comes with varying levels of risk; in some ways, this can translate directly to the degree of emphasis for pushing substantial change.  At the very foundation or root of cyberspace systems and processes are tenets and rules governed by principles in mathematics. Topics such as encrypting or decrypting file transmissions, modeling networks, performing data analysis, quantifying uncertainty, measuring risk, and weighing decisions or adversarial courses of action represent a very small subset of activities highlighted by mathematics. To facilitate education and a greater awareness of the role of mathematics in cyber systems and processes, a description of research in this area is needed.  Mathematics in Cyber Research aims to familiarize educators and young researchers with the breadth of mathematics in cyber-related research. Each chapter introduces a mathematical sub-field, describes relevant work in this field associated with the cyber domain, provides methods and tools, as well as details cyber research examples or case studies. Features    One of the only books to bring together such a diverse and comprehensive range of topics within mathematics and apply them to cyber research.    Suitable for college undergraduate students or educators that are either interested in learning about cyber-related mathematics or intend to perform research within the cyber domain. The book may also appeal to practitioners within the commercial or government industry sectors.    Most national and international venues for collaboration and discussion on cyber matters have focused primarily on the topics of law, policy, strategy, and technology. This book is among the first to address the underpinning mathematics.},

  abstract = {This book can be seen either as a text on theorem proving that uses techniques from general algebra, or else as a text on general algebra illustrated and made concrete by practical exercises in theorem proving. The book considers several different logical systems, including first-order logic, Horn clause logic, equational logic, and first-order logic with equality. Similarly, several different proof paradigms are considered. However, we do emphasize equational logic, and for simplicity we use only the OBJ3 software system, though it is used in a rather flexible manner. We do not pursue the lofty goal of mechanizing proofs like those of which mathematicians are justly so proud; instead, we seek to take steps towards providing mechanical assistance for proofs that are useful for computer scientists in developing software and hardware. This more modest goal has the advantage of both being achievable and having practical benefits. The following topics are covered: many-sorted signature, algebra and homomorphism; term algebra and substitution; equation and satisfaction; conditional equations; equational deduction and its completeness; deduction for conditional equations; the theorem of constants; interpretation and equivalence of theories; term rewriting, termination, confluence and normal form; abstract rewrite systems; standard models, abstract data types, initiality, and induction; rewriting and deduction modulo equations; first-order logic, models, and proof planning; second-order algebra; order-sorted algebra and rewriting; modules; unification and completion; and hidden algebra. In parallel with these are a gradual introduction to OBJ3, applications to group theory, various abstract data types (such as number systems, lists, and stacks), propositional calculus, hardware verification, the \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}-calculus, correctness of functional programs, and other topics.},

Recently, subgraph-restricted matchings have been proposed, which require some properties from the subgraph induced by M-saturated vertices of G. We treat the disconnected matching problem, whose property is that the referred induced subgraph is disconnected. Although some efficient algorithms have already been shown for some classes, the complexity of the general problem remained opened. We present a proof that the disconnected matching is NP-complete, even for bipartite graphs with limited diameter.},

In the present work, we develop modular methods to reason about program equivalence in call-by-push-value, and in fine-grain call-by-value, which is a popular lightweight call-by-value sublanguage of the former. Our approach is based on the fundamental observation that presheaf categories of sorted sets are suitable universes to model call-by-(push)-value languages, and that natural, coalgebraic notions of program equivalence such as applicative similarity and logical relations can be developed within. Starting from this observation, we formalize fine-grain call-by-value and call-by-push-value in the higher-order abstract GSOS framework, reduce their key congruence properties to simple syntactic conditions by leveraging existing theory and argue that introducing changes to either language incurs minimal proof overhead.},

  abstract = {Compositionality proofs in higher-order languages are notoriously involved, and general semantic frameworks guaranteeing compositionality are hard to come by. In particular, Turi and Plotkin's bialgebraic abstract GSOS framework, which provides off-the-shelf compositionality results for first-order languages, so far does not apply to higher-order languages. In the present work, we develop a theory of abstract GSOS specifications for higher-order languages, in effect transferring the core principles of Turi and Plotkin's framework to a higher-order setting. In our theory, the operational semantics of higher-order languages is represented by certain dinatural transformations that we term {\textbackslash}emph\{(pointed) higher-order GSOS laws\}. We give a general compositionality result that applies to all systems specified in this way and discuss how compositionality of combinatory logics and the \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-calculus w.r.t.{\textbackslash} a strong variant of Abramsky's applicative bisimilarity are obtained as instances.},

  abstract = {Like the notion of computation via (strong) monads serves to classify various flavours of impurity, including exceptions, non-determinism, probability, local and global store, the notion of guardedness classifies well-behavedness of cycles in various settings. In its most general form, the guardedness discipline applies to general symmetric monoidal categories and further specializes to Cartesian and co-Cartesian categories, where it governs guarded recursion and guarded iteration respectively. Here, even more specifically, we deal with the semantics of call-by-value guarded iteration. It was shown by Levy, Power and Thielecke that call-by-value languages can be generally interpreted in Freyd categories, but in order to represent effectful function spaces, such a category must canonically arise from a strong monad. We generalize this fact by showing that representing guarded effectful function spaces calls for certain parametrized monads (in the sense of Uustalu). This provides a description of guardedness as an intrinsic categorical property of programs, complementing the existing description of guardedness as a predicate on a category.},

In the other words, there is no Boolean (AND,OR)-formula F expressing that a given graph with k{\textasciicircum}4 vertices contains a clique of k elements, provided that the circuit length of F, cl(F), is polynomial in k. In fact, for any solution F in question, cl(F) must be exponential in k. Moreover this holds also for DeMorgan normal (abbr.: DMN) (AND,OR)-formulas F that allow negated variables. Based on the latter observation I consider an arbitrary (AND,OR,NOT)-formula F and recall that standard NOT-conversions to DMN at most double its circuit length. Hence for any Boolean solution F of CLIQUE(k{\textasciicircum}4,k), cl(F) is exponential in k. I conclude that CLIQUE(k{\textasciicircum}4,k) is not solvable by polynomial-size Boolean circuits, and hence P is not NP. The entire proof is formalizable by standard methods in the exponential function arithmetic EFA.},

Place bisimilarity {$\sim$}p was claimed decidable in [2], but its decidability was not really proved. We show that it is possible to decide {$\sim$}p with a simple algorithm, which essentially scans all the place relations (which are finitely many) to check whether they are place bisimulations. We also show that {$\sim$}p does respect the intended causal semantics of Petri nets, as it is finer than causal-net bisimilarity [19]. Moreover, we propose a slightly coarser variant, we call d-place bisimilarity {$\sim$}d , that we conjecture to be the coarsest equivalence, fully respecting causality and branching time (as it is finer than fully-concurrent bisimilarity [5]), to be decidable on finite Petri nets. Finally, two even coarser variants are discussed, namely i-place and i-d-place bisimilarities, which are still decidable, do preserve the concurrent behavior of Petri nets, but do not respect causality. These results open the way towards formal verification (by equivalence checking) of distributed systems modeled by finite Petri nets.},

Traditionally, amortized analysis has been phrased inductively, in terms of finite sequences of operations. Connecting to prior work on coalgebraic semantics for data structures, we develop the perspective that amortized analysis is naturally viewed coalgebraically in the category of algebras for a cost monad, where a morphism of coalgebras serves as a first-class generalization of potential function suitable for integrating cost and behavior. Using this simple definition, we consider amortization of other effects, such as randomization, and we compose amortization arguments in the indexed category of coalgebras. We generalize this to parallel data structure usage patterns by using coalgebras for an endoprofunctor instead of an endofunctor, combining potential using a monoidal structure on the underlying category. Finally, we adapt our discussion to the bicategorical setting, supporting imprecise amortized upper bounds.},

We describe a classic amortized data structure, the batched queue, and outline a coinductive proof of its amortized efficiency in calf, a dependent type theory for cost analysis.},

We propose a research agenda aimed at building a performant proof engine by studying the asymptotic performance of proof engines and redesigning their building blocks. As a case study, we explore equational rewriting and introduce a novel prototype proof engine building block for rewriting in Coq, utilizing proof by reflection for enhanced performance. Our prototype implementation can significantly improve the development of verified compilers, as demonstrated in a case study with the Fiat Cryptography toolchain. The resulting extracted commandline compiler is about 1000{\texttimes} faster while featuring simpler compilerspecific proofs. This work lays some foundation for scaling verification efforts and contributes to the broader goal of developing a proof engine with good asymptotic performance, ultimately aimed at enabling the verification of larger and more complex systems.},

In this work, we employ the Coq interactive theorem prover to methodically formalize the language, semantics, and syntax of propositional logic, a fundamental aspect of mathematical reasoning and proof construction. We construct four Hilbert-style axiom systems and a natural deduction system for propositional logic, and establish their equivalences through meticulous proofs. Moreover, we provide formal proofs for essential meta-theorems in propositional logic, including the Deduction Theorem, Soundness Theorem, Completeness Theorem, and Compactness Theorem. Importantly, we present an exhaustive formal proof of the Completeness Theorem in this paper. To bolster the proof of the Completeness Theorem, we also formalize concepts related to mappings and countability, and deliver a formal proof of the Cantor--Bernstein--Schr{\"o}der theorem. Additionally, we devise automated Coq tactics explicitly designed for the propositional logic inference system delineated in this study, enabling the automatic verification of all tautologies, all internal theorems, and the majority of syntactic and semantic inferences within the system. This research contributes a versatile and reusable Coq library for propositional logic, presenting a solid foundation for numerous applications in mathematics, such as the accurate expression and verification of properties in software programs and digital circuits. This work holds particular importance in the domains of mathematical formalization, verification of software and hardware security, and in enhancing comprehension of the principles of logical reasoning.},

The algorithm does \$O({\textbackslash}log T)\$ comparisons. Our running time and comparison bounds are best possible up to constant factors, thus resolving a problem that has been studied intensely since 1976 (Fredman, Theoretical Computer Science). The best previous algorithm with a bound of \$O({\textbackslash}log T)\$ on the number of comparisons has a time bound of \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{2.5\})\$ and is significantly more complicated. Our algorithm combines three classic algorithms: topological sort, heapsort with the right kind of heap, and efficient insertion into a sorted list.},

The former proof shows how to obtain polynomial and, polynomial in time checkable Dag-like proofs for all purely implicational Minimal logic tautologies. From the fact that Minimal implicational logic is PSPACE-complete we get the proof that NP=PSPACE. This first proof of NP=CoNP uses Hudelmaier linear upper-bound on the height of Sequent Calculus minimal implicational logic proofs. In an addendum to the proof of NP=PSPACE, we observe that we do not need to use Hudelmaier upper-bound since any proof of non-hamiltonicity for any graph is linear upper-bounded. By the CoNP-completeness of non-hamiltonicity, we obtain NP=CoNP as a corollary of the first proof. In this article we show the third proof of CoNP=NP, also providing polynomial size and polynomial verifiable certificates that are Dags. They are generated from normal Natural Deduction proofs, linear height upper-bounded too, by removing redundancy, i.e., repeated parts. The existence of repeated parts is a consequence of the redundancy theorem for a family of super-polynomial proofs in the purely implicational Minimal logic. It is mandatory to read at least two previous articles to get the details of the proof presented here. The article that proves the redundancy theorem and the article that shows how to remove the repeated parts of a normal Natural Deduction proof to have a polynomial Dag certificate for minimal implicational logic tautologies.},

  abstract = {This article precisely defines huge proofs within the system of Natural Deduction for the Minimal implicational propositional logic {\textbackslash}mil. This is what we call an unlimited family of super-polynomial proofs. We consider huge families of expanded normal form mapped proofs, a device to explicitly help to count the E-parts of a normal proof in an adequate way. Thus, we show that for almost all members of a super-polynomial family there at least one sub-proof or derivation of each of them that is repeated super-polynomially many times. This last property we call super-polynomial redundancy. Almost all, precisely means that there is a size of the conclusion of proofs that every proof with conclusion bigger than this size and that is huge is highly redundant too. This result points out to a refinement of compression methods previously presented and an alternative and simpler proof that CoNP=NP.},

While used in computational geometry and graphics, the data structure has a long history of application in nearest neighbor search. The objective of the nearest neighbor search problem is to efficiently find the closest point(s) to a given query point, and is the basis, in turn, of common machine learning techniques. We present in this paper a case study in the certified implementation, using the Coq proof assistant, of k-d tree construction from a set of data and the accompanying K-nearest neighbors search algorithm. Our experience demonstrates an intuitive method for specifying properties of these algorithms using the notion of list permutations.},

The framework is illustrated by a number of examples of type-theoretic concepts, including identity and equality types, and a hierarchy of universes.},

To show this, and also to give the equational characterisation of ribbon combinatory algebras, we make use of the internal PRO construction developed in Hasegawa's recent work. Interestingly, we can characterise ribbon combinatory algebras in two different ways: as balanced combinatory algebras with a trace combinator, and as balanced combinatory algebras with duality.},

A simple way to this end is to reform a concerned category into a calculus, where the instructions for the diagram chasing are given in the form of rewriting rules. We apply this idea to the categorical semantics of the linear logic. We build a calculus directly on the free category of the semantics. It enables us to perform diagram chasing as essentially one-way computations led by the rewriting rules. We verify the weak termination property of this calculus. This gives the first step towards the mechanization of diagram chasing.},

Yet, generating invariants is a notorious task already for syntactically restricted classes of loops. Rather than generating invariants for given loops, in this paper we synthesise loops that exhibit a predefined behaviour given by an invariant. From the perspective of formal loop verification, the synthesised loops are thus correct by design and no longer need to be verified.  To overcome the hardness of reasoning with arbitrarily strong invariants, in this paper we construct simple (non-nested) while loops with linear updates that exhibit polynomial equality invariants. Rather than solving arbitrary polynomial equations, we consider loop properties defined by a single quadratic invariant in any number of variables. We present a procedure that, given a quadratic equation, decides whether a loop with affine updates satisfying this equation exists. Furthermore, if the answer is positive, the procedure synthesises a loop and ensures its variables achieve infinitely many different values.},

With our approach we target the automated analysis of self-adjusting data structures, like splay trees, which so far have only manually been analysed in the literature.

For the bat-and-ball problem, the unconscious substitution hypothesis is challenged on two fronts in the present study: (1) testing for conscious representation of the errorinducing semantic content of the problem (i.e., the ``more than'' phrase, ``The bat costs \$1.00 more than the ball.''); and (2) comparing experimentally response confidence differences between standard versions of the problem and isomorphic controls (without that phrase) to verify postdecision sensitivity to the errors, following De Neys, Rossi, and Houd{\'e} (2013). Crucially, even when interference questions were included between testing and memory response, incorrect reasoners largely had accurate recall and recognition of the problem's error inducing phrase. Incorrect reasoners' intra-individual error sensitivity was replicated and extended via the introduction of a social-metacognitive measurement, which was found to be correlated with intraindividual post-decision confidence and also yielded an error sensitivity effect. Finally, latency responses verify the relationship between time spent reasoning and post-decision confidence. Implications and future directions are discussed.},

It provides logical foundation for multi-staged meta-programming. Our main contribution in this paper is a normalization by evaluation (NbE) algorithm for {$\lambda\rightarrow$} which we prove sound and complete. The NbE algorithm is a moderate extension to the standard presheaf model of simply typed {$\lambda$}-calculus. However, central to the model construction and the NbE algorithm is the observation of Kripke-style substitutions on context stacks which brings together two previously separate concepts, structural modal transformations on context stacks and substitutions for individual assumptions. Moreover, Kripke-style substitutions allow us to give a formulation for contextual types, which can represent open code in a meta-programming setting. Our work lays the foundation for extending the logical foundation by Pfenning, Wong, and Davies towards building a practical, dependently typed foundation for meta-programming.},

The size-change principle is used to check both termination and productivity, and the resulting principle is sound even if inductive and coinductive types are arbitrarily nested. A prototype has been implemented and gives a practical argument in favor of this principle. This work relies on a characterization of least and greatest fixed points as sets of winning strategies for parity games that was developed by L. Santocanale in his early work on circular proofs. The proof of correctness of the criterion relies on an extension of the language's denotational semantics to a domain of untyped values with non-deterministic sums.},

The study has shown that the problem of simplicity is in the complexity class P of polynomial problems. An advanced AKS algorithm is proposed, which will simplify the initial AKS algorithm and ensure its implementation to determine the simplicity of integers. To implement this task it is necessary to reduce algorithm computational complexity. The block diagram of the algorithm for performing the advanced AKS test is presented. The theorems for prime numbers presented in the form of polynomials were formulated and proved. The AKS algorithm consisting of two phases is implemented: at the first stage, the corresponding parameters r and s were found, and at the second stage, the identity for different values of b presented in the form of consecutive squares was checked. The adequacy of the algorithm for checking numbers for simplicity is proved by the example of a generated arbitrary number of 500 orders. Comparative characterization of the improved AKS test and the Miller-Rabin test was carried out. 50,000 tests were conducted. The maximum test time was 2.3089 s.},

In this paper we prove that the simulation is actually an equivalence: a PCF program terminates in a numeral exactly when the corresponding EAM terminates in the same numeral. It follows that the model of PCF obtained by quotienting typable EAMs by a suitable logical relation is adequate. From a definability result stating that every EAM in the model can be transformed into a PCF program with the same observational behavior, we conclude that the model is fully abstract for PCF.},

In this paper, we consider rational term rewriting by a set of commutativity rules i.e. rules of the form f (x, y) {$\rightarrow$} f (y, x), based on the framework of Aoto \& Ketema (2012). A rewrite step with a commutativity rule is specified via a regular set of redex positions, thus via a finite automaton. We present some finite automata constructions that correspond to (in particular) taking inverse rewrite steps, merging two branching rewrite steps, and merging two consecutive rewrite steps. As a corollary, we show that rational rewrite steps by the commutativity rules are closed under taking equivalence of the rewrite steps.},

  abstract = {Drawing (a multiset of) coloured balls from an urn is one of the most basic models in discrete probability theory. Three modes of drawing are commonly distinguished: multinomial (draw-replace), hypergeometric (draw-delete), and Polya (draw-add). These drawing operations are represented as maps from urns to distributions over multisets of draws. The set of urns is a metric space via the Kantorovich distance. The set of distributions over draws is also a metric space, using Kantorovich-over-Kantorovich. It is shown that these three draw operations are all isometries, that is, they exactly preserve the Kantorovich distances. Further, drawing is studied in the limit, both for large urns and for large draws. First it is shown that, as the urn size increases, the Kantorovich distances go to zero between hypergeometric and multinomial draws, and also between P{\textbackslash}'olya and multinomial draws. Second, it is shown that, as the drawsize increases, the Kantorovich distance goes to zero (in probability) between an urn and (normalised) multinomial draws from the urn. These results are known, but here, they are formulated in a novel metric manner as limits of Kantorovich distances. We call these two limit results the law of large urns and the law of large draws.},

  abstract = {We present a novel approach for teaching logic and the metatheory of logic to students who have some experience with functional programming. We define concepts in logic as a series of functional programs in the language of the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL. This allows us to make notions which are often unclear in textbooks precise, to experiment with definitions by executing them, and to prove metatheoretical theorems in full detail. We have surveyed student perceptions of our teaching approach to determine its usefulness and found that students felt that our formalizations helped them understand concepts in logic, and that they experimented with them as a learning tool. However, the approach was not enough to make students feel confident in their abilities to design and implement their own formal systems. Further studies are needed to confirm and generalize the results of our survey, but our initial results seem promising.},

In a reasonable (even if not strict) sense the same holds for intuitionistic and linear logics, which allows us to say that CoL reconciles and unifies the three traditions of logical thought (and beyond) on the basis of its natural and "universal" game semantics.

Nevertheless, researches about the use of this method are very scarce in South America. Accordingly, this research aims to discuss the impact of Peer Instruction use on higher education from a Logic in Brazilian Computer Science course. The research context is an undergraduate course in Computer Science in the first term of 2018 at the Federal University of Jata{\'i}. Sufficient evidence was found for the veracity of two propositions related to this study: (i) Peer Instruction use guarantees a learning gain of students, and (ii) Peer Instruction is well accepted by students. Therefore, it concluded that Peer Instruction use is suitable for Logic courses in Computing Higher Education in Brazil, with good acceptance from students.},

Ideally, these are supported by tools that verify the correctness of the content, allow computing with it, and produce human-readable documents. These goals are challenging to combine and state-of-the-art tools typically have to make difficult compromises. In this paper we discuss languages that have been created for this purpose, including logical languages of proof assistants and other formal systems, semi-formal languages, intermediate languages for exchanging mathematical knowledge, and language frameworks that allow building customized languages. We evaluate their advantages based on our experience in designing and applying languages and tools for formalizing mathematics. We reach the conclusion that no existing language is truly good enough yet and derive ideas for possible future improvements.}

  abstract = {The last 15 years have seen an explosion in work on explicit substitution, most of which is done in the style of the {$\lambda\sigma$}-calculus. In Kamareddine and R{\textasciiacute}{\i}os (1995a), we extended the {$\lambda$}-calculus with explicit substitutions by turning de Bruijn's meta-operators into objectoperators offering a style of explicit substitution that differs from that of {$\lambda\sigma$}. The resulting calculus, {$\lambda$}s, remains as close as possible to the {$\lambda$}-calculus from an intuitive point of view and, while preserving strong normalisation (Kamareddine and R{\textasciiacute}{\i}os, 1995a), is extended in this paper to a confluent calculus on open terms: the {$\lambda$}se-caculus. Since the establishment of these results, another calculus, {$\lambda\zeta$}, came into being in Mun{\texttildelow}oz Hurtado (1996) which preserves strong normalisation and is itself confluent on open terms. However, we believe that {$\lambda$}se still deserves attention because, while offering a new style to work with explicit substitutions, it is able to simulate one step of classical {$\beta$}-reduction, whereas {$\lambda\zeta$} is not. To prove confluence we introduce a generalisation of the interpretation method (cf. Hardin, 1989; Curien et al., 1992) to a technique which uses weak normal forms (instead of strong ones). We consider that this extended method is a useful tool to obtain confluence when strong normalisation of the subcalculus of substitutions is not available. In our case, strong normalisation of the corresponding subcalculus of substitutions se, is still a challenging open problem to the rewrite community, but its weak normalisation is established here via an effective strategy.},

  abstract = {The lambda-cube is a famous pure type system (PTS) cube of eight powerful explicit type systems that include the simple, polymorphic and dependent type theories. The lambda-cube only types Strongly Normalising (SN) terms but not all of them. It is well known that even the most powerful system of the lambda-cube can only type the same pure untyped lambda-terms that are typable by the higher-order polymorphic implicitly typed lambda-calculus Fomega, and that there is an untyped \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}-term U' that is SN but is not typable in Fomega or the lambda-cube. Hence, neither system can type all the SN terms it expresses. In this paper, we present the f-cube, an extension of the lambda-cube with finite-set declarations (FSDs) like y{\textbackslash}in\{C1,...,Cn\} : B which means that y is of type B and can only be one of C1,..., Cn. The novelty of our FSDs is that they allow to represent intersection types as Pi-types. We show how to translate and type the term U' in the f-cube using an encoding of intersection types based on FSDs. Notably, our translation works without needing anything like the usual troublesome intersection-introduction rule that proves a pure untyped lambda-term M has an intersection of k types using k independent sub-derivations. As such, our approach is useful for language implementers who want the power of intersection types without the pain of the intersection-introduction rule.},

Students on a lambda calculus course usually find this confusing. The elegant writings and research of the Curry school have settled this problem very well. This article is an ode to the contributions of the Curry school (especially the excellent book of Hindley and Seldin) on the subject of alpha congruence and substitution.},

  abstract = {The Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is ubiquitous in various areas of mathematics and computer science. Many of its variations have been studied including the Counting CSP, where the goal is to find the number of solutions to a CSP instance. The complexity of finding the exact number of solutions of a CSP is well understood (Bulatov, 2013, and Dyer and Richerby, 2013) and the focus has shifted to other variations of the Counting CSP such as counting the number of solutions modulo an integer. This problem has attracted considerable attention recently. In the case of CSPs based on undirected graphs Bulatov and Kazeminia (STOC 2022) obtained a complexity classification for the problem of counting solutions modulo p for arbitrary prime p. In this paper we report on the progress made towards a similar classification for the general CSP, not necessarily based on graphs. We identify several features that make the general case very different from the graph case such as a stronger form of rigidity and the structure of automorphisms of powers of relational structures. We provide a solution algorithm in the case p=2 that works under some additional conditions and prove the hardness of the problem under some assumptions about automorphisms of the powers of the relational structure. We also reduce the general CSP to the case that only uses binary relations satisfying strong additional conditions.},

While a model enjoying this property has not been found yet, this interesting problem acts as a powerful motivation for investigating classes of models, studying the associated theories and capturing operational properties semantically. We study a relational model presented as a relevant intersection type system, where intersection is in general non-idempotent, except for an idempotent element that is injected in the system. This model is adequate, equates many {$\lambda$}-terms that are indeed equivalent in the maximal observational theory, and satisfies an Approximation Theorem w.r.t. a system of approximants representing finite pieces of call-by-value B{\"o}hm trees. We show that these tools can be used for characterizing the most significant properties of the calculus -- namely valuability, potential valuability and solvability -- both semantically, through the notion of approximants, and logically, by means of the type assignment system. We mainly focus on the characterizations of solvability, as they constitute an original result. Finally, we prove the decidability of the inhabitation problem for our type system by exhibiting a non-deterministic algorithm, which is proven sound, correct and terminating.},

We prove that all lambda terms having the same B{\textbackslash}"ohm tree are observationally equivalent, and characterize those B{\textbackslash}"ohm-like trees arising as actual B{\textbackslash}"ohm trees of lambda terms. We also compare this approach with Ehrhard's theory of program approximation based on the Taylor expansion of lambda terms, translating each lambda term into a possibly infinite set of so-called resource terms. We provide sufficient and necessary conditions for a set of resource terms in order to be the Taylor expansion of a lambda term. Finally, we show that the normal form of the Taylor expansion of a lambda term can be computed by performing a normalized Taylor expansion of its B{\textbackslash}"ohm tree. From this it follows that two lambda terms have the same B{\textbackslash}"ohm tree if and only if the normal forms of their Taylor expansions coincide.},

On the dynamic side, we show that every single (exponential) step in the term calculus translates to a different single (exponential) step in the graphical formalism, thus capturing the original Girard's granularity of proof-nets but on the level of terms. We also show some fundamental properties of the calculus such as confluence, strong normalization, preservation of {$\beta$}-strong normalization and the existence of a strong bisimulation that captures pairs of pn-terms having the same graph reduction.},

We validate the proposed notion of meaningfulness by showing two properties (1) consistency of the theory \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{H\}\$ equating meaningless terms and (2) genericity, stating that meaningless subterms have no bearing on the significance of meaningful terms. The theory \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{H\}\$ is also shown to have a unique consistent and maximal extension. Last but not least, we show that the notions of meaningfulness and genericity in the literature for dCbN and dCbV are subsumed by the respectively ones proposed here for the dBang-calculus.},

  abstract = {Unlike other methods for theorem proving modulo with constrained clauses [12, 13], equational theorem proving modulo with constrained clauses along with its simplification techniques has not been well studied. We introduce a basic paramodulation calculus modulo equational theories E satisfying certain properties of E and present a new framework for equational theorem proving modulo E with constrained clauses. We propose an inference rule called Generalized E-Parallel for constrained clauses, which makes our inference system completely basic, meaning that we do not need to allow any paramodulation in the constraint part of a constrained clause for refutational completeness. We present a saturation procedure for constrained clauses based on relative reducibility and show that our inference system including our contraction rules is refutationally complete.},

  abstract = {We study finite first-order satisfiability (FSAT) in the constructive setting of dependent type theory. Employing synthetic accounts of enumerability and decidability, we give a full classification of FSAT depending on the first-order signature of non-logical symbols. On the one hand, our development focuses on Trakhtenbrot's theorem, stating that FSAT is undecidable as soon as the signature contains an at least binary relation symbol. Our proof proceeds by a many-one reduction chain starting from the Post correspondence problem. On the other hand, we establish the decidability of FSAT for monadic first-order logic, i.e. where the signature only contains at most unary function and relation symbols, as well as the enumerability of FSAT for arbitrary enumerable signatures. To showcase an application of Trakthenbrot's theorem, we continue our reduction chain with a many-one reduction from FSAT to separation logic. All our results are mechanised in the framework of a growing Coq library of synthetic undecidability proofs.},

The reachability problem, however, often becomes undecidable for a slight extension of finitary PCF with side effects, such as exceptions, algebraic effects, and references, which hindered the extension of the above verification tools for supporting functional programs with side effects. In this paper, we first give simple proofs of the undecidability of four extensions of finitary PCF, which would help us understand and analyze the source of undecidability. We then focus on an extension with references, and give a decidable fragment using a type system. To our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial decidable fragment that features higher-order recursive functions containing reference cells.},

  abstract = {In the last two decades, there has been much progress on model checking of both probabilistic systems and higher-order programs. In spite of the emergence of higher-order probabilistic programming languages, not much has been done to combine those two approaches. In this paper, we initiate a study on the probabilistic higher-order model checking problem, by giving some first theoretical and experimental results. As a first step towards our goal, we introduce PHORS, a probabilistic extension of higher-order recursion schemes (HORS), as a model of probabilistic higher-order programs. The model of PHORS may alternatively be viewed as a higher-order extension of recursive Markov chains. We then investigate the probabilistic termination problem -- or, equivalently, the probabilistic reachability problem. We prove that almost sure termination of order-2 PHORS is undecidable. We also provide a fixpoint characterization of the termination probability of PHORS, and develop a sound (but possibly incomplete) procedure for approximately computing the termination probability. We have implemented the procedure for order-2 PHORSs, and confirmed that the procedure works well through preliminary experiments that are reported at the end of the article.},

We derive two further practical results from this study. We show that CoLP by Gupta et al. gives rise to cut-free proofs in CLJ with fixpoint terms, and we formulate and implement a novel method of coinductive theory exploration that provides several heuristics for discovery of cut formulae in CLJ.},

  abstract = {In type theories, universe hierarchies are commonly used to increase the expressive power of the theory while avoiding inconsistencies arising from size issues. There are numerous ways to specify universe hierarchies, and theories may differ in details of cumulativity, choice of universe levels, specification of type formers and eliminators, and available internal operations on levels. In the current work, we aim to provide a framework which covers a large part of the design space. First, we develop syntax and semantics for cumulative universe hierarchies, where levels may come from any set equipped with a transitive well-founded ordering. In the semantics, we show that induction-recursion can be used to model transfinite hierarchies, and also support lifting operations on type codes which strictly preserve type formers. Then, we consider a setup where universe levels are first-class types and subject to arbitrary internal reasoning. This generalizes the bounded polymorphism features of Coq and at the same time the internal level computations in Agda.},

Basic concepts like domain, range, direct and inverse image of a function are illustrated via concrete material. From the folds made via origami, concepts and definitions such as injective function, surjective function and invertible function are explored. In addition, origamis are natural examples for composition of functions and for obtaining the inverse of these composite functions. The contribution of the approach to the concept of function via origami is in the intuitive and playful presentation of the definition of algorithm, routines and subroutines.},

The plugin collects the parts of proofs marked with the admit tactic in a Coq file, i.e., proof holes, and combines LLMs along with non-machine-learning methods to generate proof candidates for the holes. Then, CoqPilot checks if each proof candidate solves the given subgoal and, if successful, replaces the hole with it. The focus of CoqPilot is twofold. Firstly, we want to allow users to seamlessly combine multiple Coq generation approaches and provide a zero-setup experience for our tool. Secondly, we want to deliver a platform for LLM-based experiments on Coq proof generation. We developed a benchmarking system for Coq generation methods, available in the plugin, and conducted an experiment using it, showcasing the framework's possibilities.

A possible method to teach recursion to novice programmers is the use of unplugged activities, engaging tasks not involving coding. Despite having been shown to improve students' understanding of computational thinking, it has been argued that unplugged activities alone are not effective to teach recursion. In response, the authors engaged novice programmers who are non-computer science students by utilising unplugged visual activities to illustrate basic recursion concepts. Thereafter, the students were shown how to implement the activities with coding. The authors created three activities that illustrate recursion using breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) algorithms. An evaluation study with 19 students was conducted in an on-line teaching environment. Empirical results show that most students learned the covered activities. Further, the students reported that the activities were engaging, and helped them learn how to think recursively.},

Tarski's Rule is treated as a general introduction rule for implication. The general introduction rule for negation has a similar form. Maximal formulas with implication or negation as main operator require reduction procedures of a more intricate kind not present in normalisation for intuitionist logic.},

This is easily remedied by unification, for which an algorithm has already been defined and proven correct in a sorted, polyadic variant of matching logic.

Research in the area is fragmented, with a diverse set of approaches being spread across several ITP systems. This presents a significant challenge to the comparison of methods, which are often complex and difficult to replicate. Addressing this, we present BAIT, a framework for fair and streamlined comparison of learning approaches in ITP. We demonstrate BAIT's capabilities with an in-depth comparison, across several ITP benchmarks, of state-of-the-art architectures applied to the problem of formula embedding. We find that Structure Aware Transformers perform particularly well, improving on techniques associated with the original problem sets. BAIT also allows us to assess the end-to-end proving performance of systems built on interactive environments. This unified perspective reveals a novel end-to-end system that improves on prior work. We also provide a qualitative analysis, illustrating that improved performance is associated with more semantically-aware embeddings. By streamlining the implementation and comparison of Machine Learning algorithms in the ITP context, we anticipate BAIT will be a springboard for future research.},

  abstract = {Basing on an original Coq implementation of unbounded linear search for partially decidable predicates, we study the computational contents of {\textmu}-recursive functions via their syntactic representation, and a correct by construction Coq interpreter for this abstract syntax. When this interpreter is extracted, we claim the resulting OCaml code to be the natural combination of the implementation of the {\textmu}-recursive schemes of composition, primitive recursion and unbounded minimization of partial (i.e., possibly non-terminating) functions. At the level of the fully specified Coq terms, this implies the representation of higher-order functions of which some of the arguments are themselves partial functions. We handle this issue using some techniques coming from the Braga method. Hence we get a faithful embedding of {\textmu}-recursive algorithms into Coq preserving not only their extensional meaning but also their intended computational behavior. We put a strong focus on the quality of the Coq artifact which is both self contained and with a line of code count of less than 1k in total.},

We then show that this equivalence can be used to provide simple syntactic proofs of the theorems of Kowalski and Kracht characterizing the semisimple varieties of FLew-algebras and Boolean algebras with operators, and to extend them to FLe-algebras and Heyting algebras with operators. Moreover, under stronger assumptions this correspondence works at the level of individual models: the semisimple models of such a logic are precisely those which satisfy an axiomatic form of the law of the excluded middle, and a Glivenko-like connection obtains between the logic and its extension by the axiom of the excluded middle. This in particular subsumes the well-known Glivenko theorems relating intuitionistic and classical logic and the modal logics S4 and S5. As a consequence, we also obtain a description of the subclassical substructural logics which are Glivenko related to classical logic.},

They do so by offering a restricted but effective form of subtyping.    While the theory of type qualifiers is well understood and present in many programming languages today, polymorphism over type qualifiers remains an area less well examined.    We explore how such a polymorphic system could arise by constructing a calculus, System F-sub-Q, which combines the higher-rank bounded polymorphism of System F-sub with the theory of type qualifiers. We explore how the ideas used to construct System F-sub-Q can be reused in situations where type qualifiers naturally arise---in reference immutability, function colouring, and capture checking. Finally, we re-examine other qualifier systems in the literature in light of the observations presented while developing System F-sub-Q.},

  abstract = {The cut-elimination method CERES (cut-elimination by resolution) (for first- and higher order classical logic) is based on the notion of a characteristic clause set, which is extracted from an LK-proof and is always unsatisfiable. A resolution refutation of this clause set can be used as a skeleton for a proof with atomic cuts only (atomic cut normal form). This is achieved by replacing clauses from the resolution refutation by the corresponding projections of the original proof. We present a generalization of CERES (called \$\{{\textbackslash}rm CERES\}\_s\$) to first-order proof schemata. Proof schemata are parameterized sequences of first-order proofs constructed using primitive recursive definitions. We define a schematic version of the sequent calculus, called LKS, and devise algorithms to extract schematic characteristic formulas and schematic projections from these proof schemata. We also define a schematic resolution calculus for constructing ground refutations of schemata of formulas, which can be applied to refute the schematic characteristic formulas. Finally the projection schemata and resolution schemata are plugged together and one obtains a schematic representation of proofs with only quantifier-free cuts, from which schematic Herbrand sequences can be extracted. A major benefit of \$\{{\textbackslash}rm CERES\}\_s\$ is the extension of cut-elimination to inductively defined proofs: we compare \$\{{\textbackslash}rm CERES\}\_s\$ with standard calculi using induction rules and demonstrate that \$\{{\textbackslash}rm CERES\}\_s\$ is capable of performing cut-elimination where traditional methods fail.},

  abstract = {Cut-elimination, introduced by Gentzen, plays an important role in automating the analysis of mathematical proofs. The removal of cuts corresponds to the elimination of intermediate statements (lemmas), resulting in an analytic proof. CERes is a method of cut-elimination by resolution that relies on global proof transformations, in contrast to reductive methods, which use local proof-rewriting transformations. By avoiding redundant operations, it obtains a speed-up over Gentzen's traditional method (and its variations). CERes has been successfully implemented and applied to mathematical proofs, and it is fully developed for classical logic (first and higher order), multi-valued logics and G{\"o}del logic. But when it comes to mathematical proofs, intuitionistic logic also plays an important role due to its constructive characteristics and computational interpretation.  This paper presents current developments on adapting the CERes method to intuitionistic sequent calculus LJ. First of all, we briefly describe the CERes method for classical logic and the problems that arise when extending the method to intuitionistic logic. Then, we present the solutions found for the mentioned problems for the subclass LJ- (the class of intuitionistic proofs of an end-sequent containing no strong quantifiers and no formula on the right). In addition, we explain, with an example, some ideas for improving the method and covering a bigger fragment of LJ proofs. Finally, we summarize the results and point the direction for future research.},

A corresponding cut-elimination method, called schematic CERES, can be used to analyze these proofs, and to extract their (schematic) Herbrand sequents, even though Herbrand's theorem in general does not hold for proofs with induction inferences. This work focuses on the most crucial part of the schematic cut-elimination method, which is to construct a refutation of a schematic formula that represents the cut-structure of the original proof schema. We develop a new framework for schematic substitutions and define a unification algorithm for resolution schemata. Moreover, we show that this new formalism allows the extraction of a structure from the refutation schema, called a Herbrand schema, which represents its Herbrand sequent.},

We observe, with a no-go theorem, a crucial tradeoff between graduality and the key properties of normalization and closure of universes under dependent product that CIC enjoys. Beyond this Fire Triangle of Graduality, we explore the gradualization of CIC with three different compromises, each relaxing one edge of the Fire Triangle. We develop a parametrized presentation of Gradual CIC that encompasses all three variations, and develop their metatheory. We first present a bidirectional elaboration of Gradual CIC to a dependently-typed cast calculus, which elucidates the interrelation between typing, conversion, and the gradual guarantees. We use a syntactic model into CIC to inform the design of a safe, confluent reduction, and establish, when applicable, normalization. We also study the stronger notion of graduality as embedding-projection pairs formulated by New and Ahmed, using appropriate semantic model constructions. This work informs and paves the way towards the development of malleable proof assistants and dependently-typed programming languages.},

To promote automation, it is essential to capture high-level human mathematical reasoning, which we address as the problem of generating suitable propositions. We build a non-synthetic dataset from the largest repository of mechanised proofs and propose a task on causal reasoning, where a model is required to fill in a missing intermediate proposition given a causal context. Our experiments (using various neural sequence-to-sequence models) reveal that while the task is challenging, neural models can indeed capture non-trivial mathematical reasoning. We further propose a hierarchical transformer model that outperforms the transformer baseline.}

The type system supports linear typing, which enhances the safety properties of programs, but also supports non-linear typing as well, which makes the type system more convenient for programming. Just as in FPC, we show that LNL-FPC supports type-level recursion, which in turn induces term-level recursion. We also provide sound and computationally adequate categorical models for LNL-FPC that describe the categorical structure of the substructural operations of Intuitionistic Linear Logic at all non-linear types, including the recursive ones. In order to do so, we describe a new technique for solving recursive domain equations within cartesian categories by constructing the solutions over pre-embeddings. The type system also enjoys implicit weakening and contraction rules that we are able to model by identifying the canonical comonoid structure of all non-linear types. We also show that the requirements of our abstract model are reasonable by constructing a large class of concrete models that have found applications not only in classical functional programming, but also in emerging programming paradigms that incorporate linear types, such as quantum programming and circuit description programming languages.},

On the one hand, a probability theorist decomposes probabilistic state along the simple and natural product of probability spaces. On the other hand, recently developed probabilistic separation logics decompose state via relatively unfamiliar measure-theoretic constructions for computing unions of sigma-algebras and probability measures. We bridge the gap between these two perspectives by showing that these two methods of decomposition are equivalent up to a suitable equivalence of categories. Our main result is a probabilistic analog of the classic equivalence between the category of nominal sets and the Schanuel topos. Through this equivalence, we validate design decisions in prior work on probabilistic separation logic and create new connections to nominal-set-like models of probability.},

  title = {Confluence Properties of Rewrite Rules by Decreasing Diagrams},
  author = {Liu, Jiaxiang},
  abstract = {Formal methods are increasingly used for developing critical software. Proof assistants based on type theories allow to formally prove properties of software, in particular partial or total correctness. In expressive type theories allowing for dependent types, computations based on rewriting play a fundamental role in identifying types up to computation, such as even(2 + 2) and even(4 + 0) which both compute to even(4). This is possible thanks to two crucial properties of rewrite rules, termination and confluence. A third essential, more semantical property, is type preservation. Confluence is the property of rewriting-based computations expressing that the associated extensional relation is functional, implying uniqueness of normal forms, which exist thanks to termination. In this thesis, we are interested in confluence. Note that this problem is already present in algebraic specification languages, such as OBJ or the functional kernel of Maude. In those simply typed languages without functional types, type preservation is an easy property of the rules, and proving termination can be done independently of confluence. The confluence proof can therefore use the termination property. This is not possible in typed theories, for which termination, confluence of typed terms, and type preservation, depend on each other. Proving confluence on untyped terms is the usual way out, and can then be done first. The difficulty is that computations do not terminate on untyped terms, hence confluence must be proved for non-terminating computations. Our interest in this thesis is therefore to develop confluence proof methods in the presence of non-terminating computations.},

It has long been argued that discrete math is better taught with programming, which takes concepts and computing methods and turns them into executable programs. What has been lacking is a principled approach that supports all central concepts of discrete math -- especially predicate logic -- and that directly and precisely connects math notations with executable programs. This paper introduces such an approach. It is based on the use of a powerful language that extends the Python programming language with proper logic quantification ("for all" and "exists some"), as well as declarative set comprehension (also known as set builder) and aggregation (e.g., sum and product). Math and logical statements can be expressed precisely at a high level and be executed directly on a computer, encouraging declarative programming together with algorithmic programming. We describe the approach, detailed examples, experience in using it, and the lessons learned.},

  abstract = {The introduction of separation logic has led to the development of symbolic execution techniques and tools that are (functionally) compositional with function specifications that can be used in broader calling contexts. Many of the compositional symbolic execution tools developed in academia and industry have been grounded on a formal foundation, but either the function specifications are not validated with respect to the underlying separation logic of the theory, or there is a large gulf between the theory and the implementation of the tool. We introduce a formal compositional symbolic execution engine which creates and uses function specifications from an underlying separation logic and provides a sound theoretical foundation for, and indeed was partially inspired by, the Gillian symbolic execution platform. This is achieved by providing an axiomatic interface which describes the properties of the consume and produce operations used in the engine to update compositionally the symbolic state, for example when calling function specifications. This consume-produce technique is used by VeriFast, Viper, and Gillian, but has not been previously characterised independently of the tool. As part of our result, we give consume and produce operations inspired by the Gillian implementation that satisfy the properties described by our axiomatic interface. A surprising property is that our engine semantics provides a common foundation for both correctness and incorrectness reasoning, with the difference in the underlying engine only amounting to the choice to use satisfiability or validity. We use this property to extend the Gillian platform, which previously only supported correctness reasoning, with incorrectness reasoning and automatic true bug-finding using incorrectness bi-abduction.},

The formalization of syntactic SOS rule formats, which enforce some form of well-behavedness, has so far received less attention. GSOS is a rule format that enjoys the property that the operational semantics and denotational semantics, both derived from the same set of GSOS rules, are consistent. The present paper formalizes the underlying theory in the theorem prover COQ, and proves the consistency property, also known as the adequacy theorem. The inspiration for our work has been drawn from the field of bialgebraic semantics.},

The crux of this proof is to establish that some sequences satisfy a common recurrence.

  abstract = {Abstract             Proof theory is a central area of mathematical logic of special interest to philosophy. It has its roots in the foundational debate of the 1920s, in particular, in Hilbert's program in the philosophy of mathematics, which called for a formalization of mathematics, as well as for a proof, using philosophically unproblematic, ``finitary'' means, that these systems are free from contradiction. Structural proof theory investigates the structure and properties of proofs in different formal deductive systems, including axiomatic derivations, natural deduction, and the sequent calculus. Central results in structural proof theory are the normalization theorem for natural deduction, proved here for both intuitionistic and classical logic, and the cut-elimination theorem for the sequent calculus. In formal systems of number theory formulated in the sequent calculus, the induction rule plays a central role. It can be eliminated from proofs of sequents of a certain elementary form: every proof of an atomic sequent can be transformed into a ``simple'' proof. This is Hilbert's central idea for giving finitary consistency proofs. The proof requires a measure of proof complexity called an ordinal notation. The branch of proof theory dealing with mathematical systems such as arithmetic thus has come to be called ordinal proof theory. The theory of ordinal notations is developed here in purely combinatorial terms, and the consistency proof for arithmetic presented in detail.},

Indeed, recently Prawitz and others have been discussing the so called Ecumenical Systems, where connectives from these logics can co-exist in peace. In Prawitz' system, the classical logician and the intuitionistic logician would share the universal quantifier, conjunction, negation, and the constant for the absurd, but they would each have their own existential quantifier, disjunction, and implication, with different meanings. Prawitz' main idea is that these different meanings are given by a semantical framework that can be accepted by both parties. In a recent work, Ecumenical sequent calculi and a nested system were presented, and some very interesting proof theoretical properties of the systems were established. In this work we extend Prawitz' Ecumenical idea to alethic K-modalities.}

  abstract = {The lambda calculus is a universal programming language. It can represent the computable functions, and such offers a formal counterpart to the point of view of functions as rules. Terms represent functions and this allows for the application of a term/function to any other term/function, including itself. The calculus can be seen as a formal theory with certain pre-established axioms and inference rules, which can be interpreted by models. Dana Scott proposed the first non-trivial model of the extensional lambda calculus, known as \$ D\_{\textbackslash}infty\$, to represent the \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-terms as the typical functions of set theory, where it is not allowed to apply a function to itself. Here we propose a construction of an \${\textbackslash}infty\$-groupoid from any lambda model endowed with a topology. We apply this construction for the particular case \$D\_{\textbackslash}infty\$, and we see that the Scott topology does not provide enough information about the relationship between higher homotopies. This motivates a new line of research focused on the exploration of \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-models with the structure of a non-trivial \${\textbackslash}infty\$-groupoid to generalize the proofs of term conversion (e.g., \${\textbackslash}beta\$-equality, \${\textbackslash}eta\$-equality) to higher-proofs in \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-calculus.},

  abstract = {The lambda calculus is a universal programming language that represents the functions computable from the point of view of the functions as a rule, that allow the evaluation of a function on any other function. This language can be seen as a theory, with certain pre-established axioms and inference rules, which can be represented by models. Dana Scott proposed the first non-trivial model of the extensional lambda calculus, known as \$D\_{\i}nfty\$ , in order to represent the {$\lambda$}-terms as the typical functions of set theory, where it is not allowed to evaluate a function about itself. Here we propose a construction of a \${\i}nfty\$-groupoid from any lambda model endowed with a topology, with the purpose of projecting \$D\_{\i}nfty\$, with the Scott topology, to an extensional lambda model with an \${\i}nfty\$-groupoid structure under a composition operation between cells.}

  abstract = {It is well-known in the field of programming languages that dealing with variable names and binders may lead to conflicts such as undesired captures when implementing interpreters or compilers. This situation has been overcome by resorting to de Bruijn indices for calculi where binders capture only one variable name, like the {$\lambda$}-calculus. The advantage of this approach relies on the fact that so-called {$\alpha$}-equivalence becomes syntactical equality when working with indices. In recent years pattern calculi have gained considerable attention given their expressiveness. They turn out to be notoriously convenient to study the foundations of modern functional programming languages modeling features like pattern matching, path polymorphism, pattern polymorphism, etc. However, the literature falls short when it comes to dealing with {$\alpha$}-conversion and binders capturing simultaneously several variable names. Such is the case of the Pure Pattern Calculus (PPC): a natural extension of {$\lambda$}-calculus that allows to abstract virtually any term. This paper extends de Bruijn's ideas to properly overcome the multi-binding problem by introducing a novel presentation of PPC with bidimensional indices, in an effort to implement a prototype for a typed functional programming language based on PPC that captures path polymorphism.}

We come to the conclusion that (an enriched version of) the propositional fragment of GS4 -- i.e. the one-sided variant of Kleene's context-sharing style sequent system G4, where independent rule applications permute freely -- is an ideal framework in which to attack the problem. We show that the graph induced by axiom rules linking dual atom occurrences is preserved under arbitrary rule permutations in the cut-free fragment of GS4. We then refine the notion of axiom-induced graph so as to extend the result to derivations with cuts, and we exploit the invertibility of logical rules to define a global normalisation procedure that preserves the refined axiom-induced graphs, thus yielding a nontrivial invariant of cut-elimination in GS4. Finally, we build upon the result to devise a new proof system for classical propositional logic, where the rule permutations of GS4 reduce to identities.},

  abstract = {We develop fibrational perspectives on context-free grammars and on nondeterministic finite-state automata over categories and operads. A generalized CFG is a functor from a free colored operad (aka multicategory) generated by a pointed finite species into an arbitrary base operad: this encompasses classical CFGs by taking the base to be a certain operad constructed from a free monoid, as an instance of a more general construction of an {\textbackslash}emph\{operad of spliced arrows\} \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{W\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$ for any category \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$. A generalized NFA is a functor from an arbitrary bipointed category or pointed operad satisfying the unique lifting of factorizations and finite fiber properties: this encompasses classical word automata and tree automata without \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$-transitions, but also automata over non-free categories and operads. We show that generalized context-free and regular languages satisfy suitable generalizations of many of the usual closure properties, and in particular we give a simple conceptual proof that context-free languages are closed under intersection with regular languages. Finally, we observe that the splicing functor \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{W\} : Cat {\textbackslash}to Oper\$ admits a left adjoint \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}: Oper {\textbackslash}to Cat\$, which we call the {\textbackslash}emph\{contour category\} construction since the arrows of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\$ have a geometric interpretation as oriented contours of operations of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\$. A direct consequence of the contour / splicing adjunction is that every pointed finite species induces a universal CFG generating a language of {\textbackslash}emph\{tree contour words.\} This leads us to a generalization of the Chomsky-Sch{\textbackslash}"utzenberger Representation Theorem, establishing that a subset of a homset \$L {\textbackslash}subseteq {\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}(A,B)\$ is a CFL of arrows if and only if it is a functorial image of the intersection of a \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$-chromatic tree contour language with a regular language.},

  abstract = {Prime numbers play a very vital role in modern cryptography and especially the difficulties involved in factoring numbers composed of product of two large prime numbers have been put to use in many modern cryptographic designs. Thus, the problem of distinguishing prime numbers from the rest is vital and therefore there is a need to have efficient primality testing algorithms. Although there had been many probabilistic algorithms for primality testing, there wasn't a deterministic polynomial time algorithm until 2002 when Agrawal, Kayal and Saxena came with an algorithm, popularly known as the AKS algorithm, which could test whether a given number is prime or composite in polynomial time. This project is an attempt at understanding the ingenious idea behind this algorithm and the underlying principles of mathematics that is required to study it. In fact, through out this project, one of the major objectives has been to make it as much self contained as possible. Finally, the project provides an implementation of the algorithm using Software for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation (SAGE) and arrives at conclusions on how practical or otherwise it is.}

The salient feature of this structure is that its elements can be seen both as truth values and as (generalized) realizers, thus blurring the frontier between proofs and types. We show that each implicative algebra induces a (Set-based) tripos, using a construction that is reminiscent from the construction of a realizability tripos from a partial combinatory algebra. Relating this construction with the corresponding constructions in forcing and realizability, we conclude that the class of implicative triposes encompass all forcing triposes (both intuitionistic and classical), all classical realizability triposes (in the sense of Krivine) and all intuitionistic realizability triposes built from partial combinatory algebras.},

We aim at capturing some of these tactics into a system of ND for minimal logic. Our goal is twofold: formal and didactic. The former delivers a formal system with its underlying heuristics to build proofs, which in turn serves our latter purpose, that of making an ideal system for the teaching of ND at an undergraduate level in a computer science program.},

But there are crucial differences, splitting the two into a "Higher Ceiling Machine" and a "Lower Ceiling Machine." A potential graph of state transitions of the Higher Ceiling Machine is then offered. This graph is termed the "canonically nondeterministic solution" or CNDS, whose accompanying problem is its own replication, i.e., the problem, "Replicate CNDS" (whose accompanying algorithm is cast in Martin-L{\textbackslash}"of type theory). I then show that while this graph can be replicated (solved) in polynomial time by a nondeterministic machine -- of which the Higher Ceiling Machine is a canonical example -- it cannot be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic machine, of which the Lower Ceiling Machine is also canonical. It is consequently proven that P \${\textbackslash}neq\$ NP.},

  abstract = {We present IrisFit, a Separation Logic with space credits for reasoning about heap space in a concurrent call-by-value {$\lambda$}-calculus equipped with tracing garbage collection and shared mutable state. Space credits, a purely logical device, are consumed when a heap block is allocated and recovered when a block becomes provably unreachable. For each allocated address, ``pointed-by-heap'' and ``pointed-by-thread'' assertions record which heap blocks point to this address and which threads hold this address as a root. We point out a fundamental difficulty in the analysis of the worst-case heap space complexity of concurrent programs in the presence of tracing garbage collection: if garbage collection phases and steps of the program's threads can be arbitrarily interleaved, then there exist undesirable scenarios where a root held by a sleeping thread prevents a possibly large amount of memory from being freed. This phenomenon leads to degraded worstcase heap space complexity bounds and to more complex logical specifications: for example, in a naive implementation of Treiber's lock-free stack, one cannot prove that ``pop frees up one list cell worth of heap space''. To remedy this problem, we propose two language features, namely protected sections, where garbage collection is disabled, and polling points, instructions that block the current thread if garbage collection has been requested. Protected sections can be exploited by the programmer to eliminate undesirable scenarios and thereby obtain better worst-case heap space complexity. Polling points can be inserted by the compiler to guarantee liveness. The heart of our contribution is IrisFit, a novel program logic that can establish worst-case heap space complexity bounds and whose reasoning rules can take advantage of the presence of protected sections. We construct IrisFit inside the Coq proof assistant on top of the Iris Separation Logic framework. We prove that IrisFit offers both a safety guarantee---programs cannot crash and cannot exceed a heap space limit---and a liveness guarantee---every memory allocation request is satisfied after a bounded number of execution steps by other threads. We illustrate the use of IrisFit via a number of case studies, including a version of Treiber's stack that is correctly decorated with protected sections.

  abstract = {The first seeds of mathematical intuitionism germinated in Europe over a century ago in the constructive tendencies of Borel, Baire, Lebesque, Poincar{\'e}, Kronecker and others. The flowering was the work of one man, Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer, who taught mathematics at the University of Amsterdam from 1909 until 1951. By proving powerful theorems on topological invariants and fixed points of continuous mappings, Brouwer quickly build a mathematical reputation strong enough to support his revolutionary ideas about the nature of mathematical activity. These ideas influenced Hilbert and G{\"o}del and established intuitionistic logic and mathematics as subjects worthy of independent study. Our aim is to describe the development of Brouwer's intuitionism, from his rejection of the classical law of excluded middle to his controversial theory of the continuum, with fundamental consequences for logic and mathematics. We borrow Kleene's formal axiomatic systems (incorporating earlier attempts by Kolmogorov, Glivenko, Heyting and Peano) for intuitionistic logic and arithmetic as subtheories of the corresponding classical theories, and sketch his use of g{\"o}del numbers of recursive functions to realize sentences of intuitionistic arithmetic including a form of Church's Thesis. Finally, we present Kleene and Vesley's axiomatic treatment of Brouwer's continuum, with the function-realizability interpretation which establishes its consistency.}

These termination criteria are defined on a computational model that consists of a basic functional language called PVS0, which is an embedding of recursive first-order functions. Through this embedding, the native mechanism for checking termination of recursive functions in PVS could be soundly extended with semi-automatic termination criteria such as calling contexts graphs.},

We then adapt and extend a prior intra-procedural symbolic execution algorithm to build a bottom-up, inter-procedural and incremental analysis for detecting vulnerabilities. We prove our approach sound in Isabelle/HOL and implement it in a proof-of-concept tool, Underflow, for analysing C programs, which we apply to various case studies.},

  abstract = {We present a logic named L\_\{LF\} whose intended use is to formalize properties of specifications developed in the dependently typed lambda calculus LF. The logic is parameterized by the LF signature that constitutes the specification. Atomic formulas correspond to typing derivations relative to this signature. The logic includes a collection of propositional connectives and quantifiers. Quantification ranges over expressions that denote LF terms and LF contexts. Quantifiers of the first variety are qualified by simple types that describe the functional structure associated with the variables they bind; deeper, dependency related properties are expressed by the body of the formula. Context-level quantifiers are qualified by context schemas that identify patterns of declarations out of which actual contexts may be constructed. The semantics of variable-free atomic formulas is articulated via the derivability in LF of the judgements they encode. Propositional constants and connectives are understood in the usual manner and the meaning of quantifiers is explicated through substitutions of expressions that adhere to the type qualifications. The logic is complemented by a proof system that enables reasoning that is sound with respect to the described semantics. The main novelties of the proof system are the provision for case-analysis style reasoning about LF judgements, support for inductive reasoning over the heights of LF derivations and the encoding of LF meta-theorems. The logic is motivated by the paradigmatic example of type assignment in the simply-typed lambda calculus and the proof system is illustrated through the formalization of a proof of type uniqueness for this calculus.},

Included in the collection is the exercise of demonstrating transitivity of subtyping for a specific algorithmic formulation of subtyping for an extension of System F. The challenge represented by this problem derives from the fact that, for the given formulation, subtyping must be proved simultaneously with another property called narrowing. In a paper published as a proof pearl, Brigitte Pientka claimed to have presented a solution to the problem in which "the full power of parametric and higher-order judgments" is exploited to "get the narrowing lemma for free." We show this claim to be inaccurate. In particular, we show that the simplification is in substantial part the result of changing the formulation of the subtyping relation in a way that modifies the challenge rather than the outcome of the manner in which the argument is mechanized.},

  abstract = {In 1968, Orevkov presented proofs of conservativity of classical over intuitionistic and minimal predicate logic with equality for seven classes of sequents, what are known as Glivenko classes. The proofs of these results, important in the literature on the constructive content of classical theories, have remained somehow cryptic. In this paper, direct proofs for more general extensions are given for each class by exploiting the structural properties of G3 sequent calculi; for five of the seven classes the results are strengthened to height-preserving statements, and it is further shown that the constructive and minimal proofs are identical in structure to the classical proof from which they are obtained.},

  abstract = {Dependent type theory gives an expressive type system which facilitates succinct formalizations of mathematical concepts. In practice, it is mainly used for interactive theorem proving in the propositionsas-types style, with PVS being a notable exception. In this paper, we present native rules for automated reasoning in a dependently-typed version (DHOL) of classical higher-order logic (HOL). DHOL has an extensional type theory with an undecidable type checking problem which contains theorem proving. We implemented the inference rules as well as an automatic type checking mode in Lash, a fork of Satallax, the leading tableaux-based prover for HOL. Our method is sound and complete with respect to provability in DHOL. Completeness is guaranteed by the incorporation of a sound and complete translation from DHOL to HOL recently proposed by Rothgang et al. While this translation can already be used as a preprocessing step to any HOL prover, to achieve better performance, our system directly works in DHOL. Moreover, experimental results show that the DHOL version of Lash can outperform all major HOL provers executed on the translation.},

Our main contribution relates the denotational cost semantics of \${\textbackslash}textbf\{PCF\}\_{\textbackslash}mathsf\{cost\}\$ to its computational cost semantics, a new kind of dynamic semantics for program execution that serves as a mathematically natural alternative to operational semantics in SDT. In particular we prove an internal, cost-sensitive version of Plotkin's computational adequacy theorem, giving a precise correspondence between the denotational and computational semantics for complete programs at base type. The constructions and proofs of this paper take place in the internal dependent type theory of an SDT topos extended by a phase distinction in the sense of Sterling and Harper. By controlling the interpretation of cost structure via the phase distinction in the denotational semantics, we show that \${\textbackslash}textbf\{PCF\}\_{\textbackslash}mathsf\{cost\}\$ programs also evince a noninterference property of cost and behavior. We verify the axioms of the type theory by means of a model construction based on relative sheaf models of SDT.},

  abstract = {The type theory described in this chapter has been developed by Martin-L{\"o}f with the original aim of being a clarification of constructive mathematics. Unlike most other formalizations of mathematics, type theory is not based on predicate logic. Instead, the logical constants are interpreted within type theory through the Curry-Howard correspondence between propositions and sets [Curry and Feys, 1958; Howard, 1980]: a proposition is interpreted as a set whose elements represent the proofs of the proposition. It is also possible to view a set as a problem description in a way similar to Kolmogorov's explanation of the intuitionistic propositional calculus [Kolmogorov, 1932]. In particular, a set can be seen as a specification of a programming problem; the elements of the set are then the programs that satisfy the specification. An advantage of using type theory for program construction is that it is possible to express both specifications and programs within the same formalism. Furthermore, the proof rules can be used to derive a correct program from a specification as well as to verify that a given program has a certain property. As a programming language, type theory is similar to typed functional languages such as ML [Gordon et al., 1979; Milner et al., 1990] and Haskell [Hudak et al, 1992], but a major difference is that the evaluation of a well-typed program always terminates. The notion of constructive proof is closely related to the notion of computer program. To prove a proposition ("x {\^I} A)(\$y{\^I}B)P(x,y) constructively means to give a function f which when applied to an element a in A gives an element b in B such that P(a, b) holds. So if the proposition ("x{\^I} A)(\$y{\^I}B)P(x,y) expresses a specification, then the function f obtained from the proof is a program satisfying the specification. A constructive proof could therefore itself be seen as a computer program and the process of computing the value of a program corresponds to the process of normalizing a proof. It is by this computational content of a constructive proof that type theory can be used as a programming language; and since the program is obtained from a proof of its specification, type theory can be used as a programming logic.},

  abstract = {The uncountability of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$ (Cantor, 1874) is famous like few other theorems are; we investigate the logical and computational properties of \${\textbackslash}textsf\{NIN\}\$ (resp. \${\textbackslash}textsf\{NBI\}\$) the statement there is no injection (resp. bijection) from \$[0,1]\$ to \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\$. While intuitively weak, \${\textbackslash}textsf\{NIN\}\$ (and similar for \${\textbackslash}textsf\{NBI\}\$) is classified as rather strong on the 'normal' scale, both in terms of which comprehension axioms prove \${\textbackslash}textsf\{NIN\}\$ and which discontinuous functionals compute (Kleene S1-S9) the real numbers from \${\textbackslash}textsf\{NIN\}\$ from the data. Indeed, full second-order arithmetic is essential in each case. To obtain a classification in which \${\textbackslash}textsf\{NIN\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}textsf\{NBI\}\$ are weak, we explore the 'non-normal' scale based on (classically valid) continuity axioms and non-normal functionals, going back to Brouwer. In doing so, we derive \${\textbackslash}textsf\{NIN\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}textsf\{NBI\}\$ from basic theorems, like Arzel{\textbackslash}`a's convergence theorem for the Riemann integral (1885) and central theorems from Reverse Mathematics formulated with the standard definition of `countable set' involving injections or bijections to \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\$. Thus, the uncountability of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$ is a corollary to basic mainstream mathematics; \${\textbackslash}textsf\{NIN\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}textsf\{NBI\}\$ are (among) the weakest principles on the non-normal scale, which serendipitously reproves many of our previous results. Moreover, the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem for countable sets in Cantor space is weak, but gives rise to \${\textbackslash}Pi\_2{\textasciicircum}1\$-\${\textbackslash}textsf\{CA\}\_0\$ when combined with higher-order \${\textbackslash}Pi\_1{\textasciicircum}1\$-\${\textbackslash}textsf\{CA\}\_0\$, i.e. the Suslin functional. Finally, \${\textbackslash}textsf\{NIN\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}textsf\{NBI\}\$ allow us to showcase to a wide audience the techniques (like Gandy selection) used in our ongoing project on the logical and computational properties of the uncountable.},

Intuitively, this means that we can mark the exponential with labels taken from a set I organized in a pre-order \${\textbackslash}preceq\$, obtaining (possibly infinitely-many) exponentials (\$!{\textasciicircum}i\$ for \$i{\textbackslash}in I\$). There are, however, two main differences between multi-modalities in normal modal logics and subexponentials in linear logic. i. substructural behaviour. Subexponentials carry the possibility of having different structural behaviors; ii. nature of modalities. Normal modal logics start from the weakest version, assuming only axiom K, then extensions are considered, by adding other axioms. Exponentials in linear logic "take for granted" the behaviors expressed by axioms T and 4. Regarding (i), originally subexponentials could assume only weakening and contraction axioms, but later non-commutative/non-associative systems allowing commutative/ associative subexponentials were presented. Concerning (ii), Guerrini et al unified the modal and LL approaches, with the exponentials assuming only the linear version of K, with the possibility of adding modal extensions to it. This discussion was brought to multi-modal case, where subexponentials consider not only the structural axioms for contraction and weakening, but also the subexponential version of axioms \{K,4,D,T\}. In this work, we intend to join these two studies. This means that \$!{\textasciicircum}\{i\}\$ can behave classically or not, model associative and commutative systems or not, but also with exponential behaviors different from those in LL. Hence, by assigning different modal axioms one obtains, in a modular way, a class of different substructural modal logics.},

Although undecidable in general, these structural properties are crucial in proof theory because they can reduce the proof-search effort and further be used as scaffolding for obtaining other meta-results such as consistency. The algorithms -- which take advantage of the rewriting logic meta-logical framework, and use rewrite- and narrowing-based reasoning -- are explained in detail and illustrated with examples throughout the paper. They have been fully mechanized in the L-Framework, thus offering both a formal specification language and off-the-shelf mechanization of the proof-search algorithms coming together with semi-decision procedures for proving theorems and meta-theorems of the object system. As illustrated with case studies in the paper, the L-Framework, achieves a great degree of automation when used on several propositional sequent systems, including single conclusion and multi-conclusion intuitionistic logic, classical logic, classical linear logic and its dyadic system, intuitionistic linear logic, and normal modal logics.},

A typical encoding of the terminating TRS rule a(b(x)) -{$>$} b(a(x)), for example, may be indefinitely applicable along a cycle of a's and b's. Recently, we introduced PBPO+, a graph rewriting formalism in which rules employ a type graph to specify transformations and control rule applicability. In the present paper, we show that PBPO+ allows for a natural encoding of linear TRS rules that preserves termination globally. This result is a step towards modeling other rewriting formalisms, such as lambda calculus and higher order rewriting, using graph rewriting in a way that preserves properties like termination and confluence. We moreover expect that the encoding can serve as a guide for lifting TRS termination methods to PBPO+ rewriting.},

  abstract = {On the ground of a general theorem concerning the admissibility of the structural rules in sequent calculi with additional atomic rules, we develop a proof theoretic analysis for several extensions of the \$\{{\textbackslash}bf G3[mic]\}\$ sequent calculi with rules for equality, including the one originally proposed by H.Wang. In the classical case we relate our results with the semantic tableau method for first order logic with equality. In particular we establish that, for languages without function symbols, in Fitting's alternative semantic tableau method, strictness (which does not allow the repetition of equalities which are modified) can be imposed together with the orientation of the replacement of equals. A significant progress is made toward extending that result to languages with function symbols although whether that is possible or not remains to be settled. We also briefly consider systems that, in the classical case, are related to the semantic tableau method in which one can expand branches by adding identities at will, obtaining that also in that case strictness can be imposed. Furthermore we discuss to what extent the strengthened form of the nonlengthening property of Orevkov known to hold for the sequent calculi with the structural rules applies also to the present context.},

A Hennessy-Milner logic for these systems is introduced, and proved adequate and expressively complete for bisimulation equivalence. A main technical novelty is the use of finitely supported infinite conjunctions. We show how to treat different bisimulation variants such as early, late, open and weak in a systematic way, explore the folklore theorem that state predicates can be replaced by actions, and make substantial comparisons with related work. The main definitions and theorems have been formalised in Nominal Isabelle.},

  abstract = {We show a new simple algorithm that checks whether a given higher-order grammar generates a nonempty language of trees. The algorithm amounts to a procedure that transforms a grammar of order n to a grammar of order n-1, preserving nonemptiness, and increasing the size only exponentially. After repeating the procedure n times, we obtain a grammar of order 0, whose nonemptiness can be easily checked. Since the size grows exponentially at each step, the overall complexity is n-EXPTIME, which is known to be optimal. More precisely, the transformation (and hence the whole algorithm) is linear in the size of the grammar, assuming that the arity of employed nonterminals is bounded by a constant. The same algorithm allows to check whether an infinite tree generated by a higher-order recursion scheme is accepted by an alternating safety (or reachability) automaton, because this question can be reduced to the nonemptiness problem by taking a product of the recursion scheme with the automaton. A proof of correctness of the algorithm is formalised in the proof assistant Coq. Our transformation is motivated by a similar transformation of Asada and Kobayashi (2020) changing a word grammar of order n to a tree grammar of order n-1. The step-by-step approach can be opposed to previous algorithms solving the nonemptiness problem "in one step", being compulsorily more complicated.},

  abstract = {In his recent and exploratory work on template games and linear logic, Melli{\textbackslash}`es defines sequential and concurrent games as categories with positions as objects and trajectories as morphisms, labelled by a specific synchronization template. In the present paper, we bring the idea one dimension higher and advocate that template games should not be just defined as 1-dimensional categories but as 2-dimensional categories of positions, trajectories and reshufflings (or reschedulings) as 2-cells. In order to achieve the purpose, we take seriously the parallel between asynchrony in concurrency and the Gray tensor product of 2-categories. One technical difficulty on the way is that the category S=2-Cat of small 2-categories equipped with the Gray tensor product is monoidal, and not cartesian. This prompts us to extend the framework of template games originally formulated by Melli{\textbackslash}`es in a category S with finite limits, and to upgrade it in the style of Aguiar's work on quantum groups to the more general situation of a monoidal category S with coreflexive equalizers, preserved by the tensor product componentwise. We construct in this way an asynchronous template game semantics of multiplicative additive linear logic (MALL) where every formula and every proof is interpreted as a labelled 2-category equipped, respectively, with the structure of Gray comonoid for asynchronous template games, and of Gray bicomodule for asynchronous strategies.},

When compared to the imperative world, there are only a handful of verification tools that can deal with functional programs. We believe the lack of pedagogical, problem-oriented documentation on how to use such tools might be one of the reasons behind this apparent mismatch between deductive verification and real-world functional software. In this paper, our goal is to drift away from this tendency. We chose the OCaml language as our working environment and provide a comprehensive, hands-on tutorial on how to apply different verification tools to OCaml-written programs. Our presentation takes an incremental approach: we first focus on purely functional programs; then on imperative programs, yet avoid pointers; finally, we use Separation Logic to reason about pointer-manipulating programs.},

  year = {2019},
  journal = {CoRR},
  abstract = {These notes were originally developed as lecture notes for a category theory course. They should be well-suited to anyone that wants to learn category theory from scratch and has a scientific mind. There is no need to know advanced mathematics, nor any of the disciplines where category theory is traditionally applied, such as algebraic geometry or theoretical computer science. The only knowledge that is assumed from the reader is linear algebra. All concepts are explained by giving concrete examples from different, non-specialized areas of mathematics (such as basic group theory, graph theory, and probability). Not every example is helpful for every reader, but hopefully every reader can find at least one helpful example per concept. The reader is encouraged to read all the examples, this way they may even learn something new about a different field. Particular emphasis is given to the Yoneda lemma and its significance, with both intuitive explanations, detailed proofs, and specific examples. Another common theme in these notes is the relationship between categories and directed multigraphs, which is treated in detail. From the applied point of view, this shows why categorical thinking can help whenever some process is taking place on a graph. From the pure math point of view, this can be seen as the 1-dimensional first step into the theory of simplicial sets. Finally, monads and comonads are treated on an equal footing, differently to most literature in which comonads are often overlooked as "just the dual to monads". Theorems, interpretations and concrete examples are given for monads as well as for comonads.}

  abstract = {The aim of this work is to provide a special kind of conservative translation between abstract logics, namely an abstract Glivenko's theorem. Firstly we define institutions on the categories of logic, algebraizable logics, and Lindenbaum algebraizable logic. In the sequel, we introduce the notion os Glivenko's context relating two algebraizable logics (respectively, Lindenbaum algebraizable logics) and we prove that for each Glivenko's context can be associated an institutions morphism between the corresponding logical institutions. As a consequence of the existence of such institutions morphisms, we have established abstract versions of Glivenko's theorem between those algebraizable logics (Lindenbaum algebraizable logics), generalizing the results presented in [Tor]. In particular, considering the institutions of classical logic and of intuitionistic logic, we build a Glivenko's context and thus an abstract Glivenko's theorem that is exactly the traditional Glivenko's theorem. Finally we present a category of algebraizable logic with Glivenko's context as morphisms. We can interpret the results of this work as an evidence of the (virtually unexplored) relevance of institution theory in the study of propositional logic.},

In the previous paper we investigated the Russell-Prawitz translation via an extended equational theory for System F arising from its categorical semantics. The main result of this paper is that the Russell-Prawitz translation and Ferreira and Ferreira's translation are equivalent modulo this extended equational theory. This result highlights a close connection between our previous work and that of Ferreira and Ferreira. We argue however that the approach obtained by coupling the original Russell-Prawitz translation with our extended equational theory is more satisfactory for the study of proof identity than the one based on System Fat.}

The use of permutations gives rise to an attractively simple formalization of common, but often technically incorrect uses of structural recursion and induction for abstract syntax modulo {$\alpha$}-equivalence. At the heart of this approach is the notion of               finitely supported               mathematical objects. This article explains the idea in as concrete a way as possible and gives a new derivation within higher-order classical logic of principles of {$\alpha$}-               structural               recursion and induction for {$\alpha$}-equivalence classes from the ordinary versions of these principles for abstract syntax trees.},

  abstract = {ANDREW M. PITTS, University of Cambridge, UK This paper provides a new mathematical foundation for the locally nameless representation of syntax with binders, one informed by nominal techniques. It gives an equational axiomatization of two key locally nameless operations, {\l}variable opening{\v z} and {\l}variable closing{\v z} and shows that a lot of the locally nameless infrastructure can be defined from that in a syntax-independent way, including crucially a {\l}shift{\v z} functor for name binding. That functor operates on a category whose objects we call locally nameless sets. Functors combining shift with sums and products have initial algebras that recover the usual locally nameless representation of syntax with binders in the finitary case. We demonstrate this by uniformly constructing such an initial locally nameless set for each instance of Plotkin's notion of binding signature. We also show by example that the shift functor is useful for locally nameless sets of a semantic rather than a syntactic character. The category of locally nameless sets is proved to be isomorphic to a known topos of finitely supported {$M$}-sets, where {$M$} is the full transformation monoid on a countably infinite set. A corollary of the proof is that several categories that have been used in the literature to model variable renaming operations on syntax with binders are all equivalent to each other and to the category of locally nameless sets. CCS Concepts: {$\bullet$} Theory of computation {$\rightarrow$} Categorical semantics; Equational logic and rewriting; Logic and verification; {$\bullet$} Software and its engineering {$\rightarrow$} Syntax.},

There is a mathematical foundation for the semantics of such features which uses groups of permutations of names and the notion of the support of an object with respect to the action of such a group. The relevance of this kind of mathematics for the semantics of names is perhaps not immediately obvious. That it is relevant and useful has emerged over the last 15 years or so in a body of work that has acquired its own name: nominal techniques. At the same time, the application of these techniques has broadened from semantics to computation theory in general. This article introduces the subject and is based upon a tutorial at LICS-ICALP 2015 [Pitts 2015a].}

Logical reasoning is applied at all levels, from everyday life to advanced sciences, and a remarkable level of complexity is achieved in everyday logical reasoning, even if the principles behind it remain intuitive. Jan von Plato provides an accessible but rigorous introduction to an important aspect of contemporary logic: its deductive machinery. He shows that when the forms of logical reasoning are analysed, it turns out that a limited set of first principles can represent any logical argument. His book will be valuable for students of logic, mathematics, and computer science"--},

Utilizing a normal form for intuitionistic logic [20], we establish a small model property for intuitionistic propositional logic. We use this property for a direct encoding of the Kripke semantics into classical propositional logic and quantified Boolean formulae. Next, we transfer the developed techniques to the first order case and provide an embedding of intuitionistic first-order logic into classical first-order-logic. Our goal here is an encoding that facilitates the use of state-of-the-art provers for classical first-order logic for deter- mining intuitionistic validity. In an experimental evaluation, we show that our approach can compete with state-of-the-art provers for certain classes of benchmarks, in particular when the intuitionistic content is low. We further note that our constructions support the transfer of counter-models to validity, which is a desired feature in model checking applications.},

Rensets compare favorably in some respects with the well-known foundation based on nominal sets. In particular, renaming is a more fundamental operator than the nominal swapping operator and enjoys a simpler, equationally expressed relationship with the variable-freshness predicate. Together with some natural axioms matching properties of the syntactic constructors, rensets yield a truly minimalistic characterization of \$\${\textbackslash}lambda \$\$-calculus terms as an abstract datatype---one involving an infinite set of unconditional equations, referring only to the most fundamental term operators: the constructors and renaming. This characterization yields a recursion principle, which (similarly to the case of nominal sets) can be improved by incorporating Barendregt's variable convention. When interpreting syntax in semantic domains, our renaming-based recursor is easier to deploy than the nominal recursor. Our results have been validated with the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL.},

A debit can be paid off in several increments; a thunk whose debit has been fully paid off can be forced. Quite strikingly, a debit is associated also with future thunks, which do not yet exist in memory. Some of the debit of a faraway future thunk can be transferred to a nearer future thunk. We present a complete machine-checked reconstruction of Okasaki's reasoning rules in Iris\$, a rich separation logic with time credits. We demonstrate the applicability of the rules by verifying a few operations on streams as well as several of Okasaki's data structures, namely the physicist's queue, implicit queues, and the banker's queue.},

While being more finely typed, our approach incurs no loss of expressiveness or efficiency. Via parametricity we obtain properties about functions polymorphic on worlds. For instance, well-typed world-polymorphic functions over open {$\lambda$}-terms commute with any renaming of the free variables. Our whole development is conducted within Agda, from the code of the library, to its soundness proof and the properties of external functions. The soundness of our library is demonstrated via the construction of a logical relations argument.},

However, using either technique, it is all too easy to make a programming error that causes one name to be used where another was intended. We propose an abstract interface to names and binders that rules out many of these errors. This interface is implemented as a library in Agda. It allows defining and manipulating term representations in nominal style and in de Bruijn style. The programmer is not forced to choose between these styles: on the contrary, the library allows using both styles in the same program, if desired. Whereas indexing the types of names and terms with a natural number is a well-known technique to better control the use of de Bruijn indices, we index types with worlds. Worlds are at the same time more precise and more abstract than natural numbers. Via logical relations and parametricity, we are able to demonstrate in what sense our library is safe, and to obtain theorems for free about world-polymorphic functions. For instance, we prove that a world-polymorphic term transformation function must commute with any renaming of the free variables. The proof is entirely carried out in Agda.},

Intuitionistic predicate logic is interpretable (also interpretable with respect to derivability) in classical predicate logic. A classical argument can be understood intuitionistically, if the formulas are interpreted throughout in the weak sense, that is, classical logic can be interpreted in intuitionistic logic by a translation that successively replaces classical formulas by their double negation.

We demonstrate how this approach can be used to automate public sector processes. Since automation of legal processes is a high-risk application of AI, we use explainable AI based on natural language processing using scope-restricted pattern matching and grammatical parsing. Our approach consists of document structure inference from the raw legal text, semantically neutral pre-processing, recognition of internal and external references, target resolution for internal references, paragraph contextualization and, finally, rule extraction. Extracted rules are converted to Prolog predicates and visualized as textual lists and graphical decision trees. Our developed Law as Code prototype has been evaluated as a proof-of-concept at the Austrian Ministry of Finance and successfully demonstrated the automatic extraction of explainable rules from the Austrian Study Funding Act. This validates our approach and suggests promising future research directions, most notably the prospect of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into the rule extraction process, while retaining provenance and explainability.},

  abstract = {Sets with atoms serve as an alternative to ZFC foundations for mathematics, where some infinite, though highly symmetric sets, behave in a finitistic way. Therefore, one can try to carry over analysis of the classical algorithms from finite structures to some infinite structures. Recent results show that this is indeed possible and leads to many practical applications. In this paper we shall take another route to finite analysis of infinite sets, which extends and sheds more light on sets with atoms. As an application of our theory we give a characterisation of languages recognized by automata definable in fragments of first-order logic.},

Their design, implementation and their use in reasoning tasks, ranging from the correctness of software to the properties of formal systems, have been the focus of considerable research over the last three decades. The LFMTP workshop brought together designers, implementors and practitioners to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure and utility of logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable binding, inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques and the expressiveness and lucidity of the reasoning process. The 2024 instance of LFMTP was organized by Florian Rabe and Claudio Sacerdoti Coen in Tallinn, Estonia, the 8th July, as a satellite event of the FSCD conference. The workshop received 8 submissions, of which 6 were presented at the workshop. Of these, 2 were work-in-progress presentations, and 4 were accepted for these formal proceedings. Additionally, Carsten Sch{\textbackslash}"urmann of IT University of Copenhagen gave an invited talk on Nominal State Separating Proofs.},

  abstract = {Several theorems about the equivalence of familiar theories of reverse mathematics with certain well-ordering principles have been proved by recursion-theoretic and combinatorial methods (Friedman, Marcone, Montalban et al.) and with far-reaching results by proof-theoretic technology (Afshari, Freund, Girard, Rathjen, Thomson, Valencia Vizcano, Weiermann et al.), employing deduction search trees and cut elimination theorems in infinitary logics with ordinal bounds in the latter case. At type level one, the well-ordering principles are of the form (*) "if X is well-ordered then f(X) is well-ordered" where f is a standard proof theoretic function from ordinals to ordinals (such f's are always dilators). One aim of the paper is to present a general methodology underlying these results that enables one to construct omega-models of particular theories from (*) and even beta-models from the type 2 version of (*). As (*) is of complexity Pi-1-2 such a principle cannot characterize stronger comprehensions at the level of Pi-1-1-comprehension. This requires a higher order version of (*) that employs ideas from ordinal representation systems with collapsing functions used in impredicative proof theory. The simplest one is the Bachmann construction. Relativizing the latter construction to any dilator f and asserting that this always yields a well-ordering turns out to be equivalent to Pi-1-1-comprehension. This result has been conjectured and a proof strategy adumbrated roughly 10 years ago, but the proof has only been worked out in recent years.},

  abstract = {Structural proof theory is praised for being a symbolic approach to reasoning and proofs, in which one can define schemas for reasoning steps and manipulate proofs as a mathematical structure. For this to be possible, proof systems must be designed as a set of rules such that proofs using those rules are correct by construction. Therefore, one must consider all ways these rules can interact and prove that they satisfy certain properties which makes them "well-behaved". This is called the meta-theory of a proof system. Meta-theory proofs typically involve many cases on structures with lots of symbols. The majority of cases are usually quite similar, and when a proof fails, it might be because of a sub-case on a very specific configuration of rules. Developing these proofs by hand is tedious and error-prone, and their combinatorial nature suggests they could be automated. There are various approaches on how to automate, either partially or completely, meta-theory proofs. In this paper, I will present some techniques that I have been involved in for facilitating meta-theory reasoning.},

  abstract = {This is an introductory textbook to univalent mathematics and homotopy type theory, a mathematical foundation that takes advantage of the structural nature of mathematical definitions and constructions. It is common in mathematical practice to consider equivalent objects to be the same, for example, to identify isomorphic groups. In set theory it is not possible to make this common practice formal. For example, there are as many distinct trivial groups in set theory as there are distinct singleton sets. Type theory, on the other hand, takes a more structural approach to the foundations of mathematics that accommodates the univalence axiom. This, however, requires us to rethink what it means for two objects to be equal. This textbook introduces the reader to Martin-L{\textbackslash}"of's dependent type theory, to the central concepts of univalent mathematics, and shows the reader how to do mathematics from a univalent point of view. Over 200 exercises are included to train the reader in type theoretic reasoning. The book is entirely self-contained, and in particular no prior familiarity with type theory or homotopy theory is assumed.},

  abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) gains greater adoption in a wide variety of applications, it has immense potential to contribute to mathematical discovery, by guiding conjecture generation, constructing counterexamples, assisting in formalizing mathematics, and discovering connections between different mathematical areas, to name a few. While prior work has leveraged computers for exhaustive mathematical proof search, recent efforts based on large language models (LLMs) aspire to position computing platforms as co-contributors in the mathematical research process. Despite their current limitations in logic and mathematical tasks, there is growing interest in melding theorem proving systems with foundation models. This work investigates the applicability of LLMs in formalizing advanced mathematical concepts and proposes a framework that can critically review and check mathematical reasoning in research papers. Given the noted reasoning shortcomings of LLMs, our approach synergizes the capabilities of proof assistants, specifically PVS, with LLMs, enabling a bridge between textual descriptions in academic papers and formal specifications in PVS. By harnessing the PVS environment, coupled with data ingestion and conversion mechanisms, we envision an automated process, called {\textbackslash}emph\{math-PVS\}, to extract and formalize mathematical theorems from research papers, offering an innovative tool for academic review and discovery.},

  abstract = {In reductive proof search, proofs are naturally generalized by solutions, comprising all possibly infinite structures generated by locally correct, bottom-up application of inference rules. We propose an extension of the Curry-Howard paradigm of representation, from proofs to solutions: to represent solutions by possibly infinite terms of a dedicated lambda-calculus. This new, comprehensive approach to proof search is exemplified with the sequent calculus LJT for intuitionistic implication logic. A finitary representation is proposed, comprising lambda-terms extended with a formal greatest fixed point, and a type system that can be seen as a logic of coinductive proofs. In the finitary system, fixed-point variables enjoy a relaxed form of binding that allows the detection of cycles through the type system. Formal sums are used to express alternatives in the search process. Moreover, formal sums are used in the coinductive syntax to define "decontraction" (contraction bottom-up) - an operation whose theory we initiate in this paper. As a semantics, we assign a coinductive lambda-term to each finitary term. The main result is the existence of an equivalent finitary representation for any full solution space expressed coinductively. This result is the main ingredient in the proof that our logic of coinductive proofs is sound and complete with respect to the coinductive semantics. These results are the foundation for an original approach to proof search, where the search builds the finitary representation of the full solution space, and the a posteriori analysis typically consisting in applying a syntax-directed procedure or function. The paper illustrates this for proof search and inhabitation problems in the simply-typed lambda-calculus, reviewing results detailed elsewhere, and including new results that obtain extensive generalizations of the so-called monatomic theorem.},

This allows to unblock \${\textbackslash}beta\$-redexes without resorting to the standard permutative conversions of generalized applications used in the original \${\textbackslash}Lambda J\$-calculus with generalized applications of Joachimski and Matthes. We show strong normalization of simply-typed terms, and we then fully characterize strong normalization by means of a quantitative (i.e. non-idempotent intersection) typing system. This characterization uses a non-trivial inductive definition of strong normalization --related to others in the literature--, which is based on a weak-head normalizing strategy. We also show that our calculus \${\textbackslash}lambda Jn\$ relates to explicit substitution calculi by means of a faithful translation, in the sense that it preserves strong normalization. Moreover, our calculus \${\textbackslash}lambda Jn\$ and the original \${\textbackslash}Lambda J\$-calculus determine equivalent notions of strong normalization. As a consequence, \${\textbackslash}lambda J\$ inherits a faithful translation into explicit substitutions, and its strong normalization can also be characterized by the quantitative typing system designed for \${\textbackslash}lambda Jn\$, despite the fact that quantitative subject reduction fails for permutative conversions.},

All of them comprise the Russell-Prawitz translation of formulas, but have different strategies for the translation of proofs. Although these embeddings preserve proof identity, all fail in delivering preservation of reduction steps. In fact, they translate the commuting conversions of IPC to beta-equality, or to other kinds of reduction or equality generated by new principles added to system F. The cause for this is the generation of redexes by the translation itself. In this paper, we present an embedding of IPC into atomic system F, still based on the same translation of formulas, but which maps commuting conversions to syntactic identity, while simulating the other kinds of reduction steps present in IPC beta{\textbackslash}eta-reduction. In this sense the translation achieves a truly commuting conversion-free image of IPC in atomic system F.},

The polarized logic can be used as a platform from which proof search for other logics is understood. We illustrate the technique with LJT, a focused sequent calculus for full intuitionistic propositional logic (including disjunction). For that, we have to work out the "negative translation" of LJT into the polarized logic (that sees all intuitionistic types as negative types), and verify that the translation gives a faithful representation of proof search in LJT as proof search in the polarized logic.},

We prove these theories are complete, model complete and they do not have quantifier elimination. Then, we focus on the class of ordered polynomials. Over \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{H\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{O\}\$ these polynomials are of special interest in hypercomplex analysis slice they are slice regular. We deduce some fundamental properties of the zero locus of ordered polynomials from completeness and we prove the failure of qantifier elimination for the fragment of ordered formulas as well.},

We define universal properties for multicategories, and use these to derive familiar rules for products, tensors, and exponentials. Finally we explain how to recover both the category-theoretic syntactic model and its semantic interpretation from the multi-ary framework. We then use these ideas to study the semantic interpretation of combinatory logic and the simply-typed lambda-calculus without products. We introduce extensional SK-clones and show these are sound and complete for both combinatory logic with extensional weak equality and the simply-typed lambda-calculus without products. We then show such SK-clones are equivalent to a variant of closed categories called SK-categories, so the simply-typed lambda-calculus without products is the internal language of SK-categories. As a corollary, we deduce that SK-categories have the same relationship to cartesian monoidal categories that closed categories have to monoidal categories.},

  year = {2020},
  abstract = {In the late 1980s Gurevich conjectured that there is no logic capturing PTIME, where "logic" has to be understood in a very general way comprising computation models over isomorphism classes of structures. In this article we first show that Gurevich's conjecture is false. For this we extend the seminal research of Blass, Gurevich and Shelah on {\textbackslash}em choiceless polynomial time (CPT), which exploits deterministic Abstract State Machines (ASMs) supporting unbounded parallelism to capture the choiceless fragment of PTIME. CPT is strictly included in PTIME. We observe that choice is unavoidable, but that a restricted version suffices, which guarantees that the final result is independent from the choice. Such a version of polynomially bounded ASMs, which we call {\textbackslash}em insignificant choice polynomial time (ICPT) will indeed capture PTIME. This can be expressed in the logic of non-deterministic ASMs plus inflationary fixed-point. We use this result for our second contribution showing that PTIME differs from NP. For the proof we build again on the research on CPT first establishing a limitation on permutation classes of the sets that can be activated by an ICPT computation. We then prove an equivalence theorem, which characterises structures that cannot be distinguished by the logic. In particular, this implies that SAT cannot be decided by an ICPT computation.}

The reason for that is that in first-order logic induction requires an infinite number of axioms, which is not a feasible input to a computer-aided theorem prover requiring a finite input. Mathematical practice is to specify these infinite sets of axioms as axiom schemes. Unfortunately these schematic definitions cannot be formalized in first-order logic, and therefore not supported as inputs for first-order theorem provers. In this work we introduce a new method, inspired by the field of axiomatic theories of truth, that allows to express schematic inductive definitions, in the standard syntax of multi-sorted first-order logic. Further we test the practical feasibility of the method with state-of-the-art theorem provers, comparing it to solvers' native techniques for handling induction.},

We postulate that provability for implicational intuitionistic propositional logic (IIPC) can serve as a similar natural tool to express problems in Pspace. This approach can be particularly convenient for two reasons. One is that provability in full IPC (with all connectives) can be reduced to provability of implicational formulas of order three. Another advantage is a convenient interpretation in terms of simple alternating automata. Additionally, we distinguish some natural subclasses of IIPC corresponding to the complexity classes NP and co-NP. Our experimental results show that a simple decision procedure requires a significant amount of time only in a small fraction of cases.},

Its history goes back to the seminal works of Turing, Kleene and others in the 1930s.A computable function is one defined by a program whose operational semantics tell an idealized computer what to do to its storage locations as it proceeds deterministically from input to output, without any prior restrictions on storage space or computation time. We shall be concerned with various program styles and the relationships between them, but the emphasis throughout this chapter and in part 2 will be on one underlying data type, namely the natural numbers, since it is there that the most basic foundational connections between proof theory and computation are to be seen in their clearest light. This is not to say that computability over more general and abstract data types is less important. Quite the contrary. For example, from a logical point of view, Stoltenberg-Hansen and Tucker [1999], Tucker and Zucker [2000], [2006] and Moschovakis [1997] give excellent presentations of a more abstract approach, and our part 3 develops a theory in higher types from a completely general standpoint.The two best-known models of machine computation are the Turing Machine and the (Unlimited) Register Machine of Shepherdson and Sturgis [1963]. We base our development on the latter since it affords the quickest route to the results we want to establish (see also Cutland [1980]).},

  abstract = {Proof assistant users rely on automation to reduce the burden of writing and maintaining proofs. By design, automation hides the details of intermediate proof steps, making proofs both shorter and more robust. However, we observed in a need-finding study that users sometimes do want to examine the details of these intermediate steps, either to understand how the proof works or to pinpoint where it has broken. To support such activities, we describe a proof deautomation procedure that reconstructs the underlying steps of an automated proof. We discuss the design considerations that shaped our approach to deautomation --- in particular, the requirement that deautomation should remain informative even for failing proofs --- and we propose a deautomation algorithm and a proof-of-concept implementation.},

The most prominent logics studied in the field are (counting) monadic second-order logic (C)MSO, and first-order logic FO and its extensions. The complexity of CMSO model checking in general and of FO model checking on monotone graph classes is very well understood. In recent years there has been a rapid and exciting development of new algorithmic meta theorems. On the one hand there has been major progress for FO model checking on hereditary graph classes. This progress was driven by the development of a combinatorial structure theory for the logically defined monadically stable and monadically dependent graph classes, as well as by the advent of the new width measure twinwidth. On the other hand, new algorithmic meta theorems for new logics with expressive power between FO and CMSO offer a new unifying view on methods like the irrelevant vertex technique and recursive understanding. In this paper we overview the recent advances in algorithmic meta theorems and provide rough sketches for the methods to prove them.},

The LLL lattice reduction algorithm and various algorithms for Hermite and Smith normal forms from computational number theory are used to study the abelian quotients of a finitely presented group. The work of Baumslag, Cannonito and Miller on computing nonabelian polycyclic quotients is described as a generalisation of Buchberger's Gr{\"o}bner basis methods to right ideals in the integral group ring of a polycyclic group.

  abstract = {Proving geometric theorems constitutes a hallmark of visual reasoning combining both intuitive and logical skills. Therefore, automated theorem proving of Olympiad-level geometry problems is considered a notable milestone in human-level automated reasoning. The introduction of AlphaGeometry, a neurosymbolic model trained with 100 million synthetic samples, marked a major breakthrough. It solved 25 of 30 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems whereas the reported baseline based on Wu's method solved only ten. In this note, we revisit the IMO-AG-30 Challenge introduced with AlphaGeometry, and find that Wu's method is surprisingly strong. Wu's method alone can solve 15 problems, and some of them are not solved by any of the other methods. This leads to two key findings: (i) Combining Wu's method with the classic synthetic methods of deductive databases and angle, ratio, and distance chasing solves 21 out of 30 methods by just using a CPU-only laptop with a time limit of 5 minutes per problem. Essentially, this classic method solves just 4 problems less than AlphaGeometry and establishes the first fully symbolic baseline, strong enough to rival the performance of an IMO silver medalist. (ii) Wu's method even solves 2 of the 5 problems that AlphaGeometry failed to solve. Thus, by combining AlphaGeometry with Wu's method we set a new state-of-the-art for automated theorem proving on IMO-AG-30, solving 27 out of 30 problems, the first AI method which outperforms an IMO gold medalist.},

  abstract = {Dependently-typed host languages empower users to verify a wide range of properties of embedded languages and programs written in them. Designers of such embedded languages are faced with a difficult choice between using a shallow or a deep embedding. The former is easier to use because the entire infrastructure of the host langauge is immediately available. Meanwhile, the latter gives full access to the structure of embedded programs, but is difficult to use in practice, especially when the embedded language is itself dependently typed. The main insight presented in this paper is that the choice between shallow and deep embedding can be eliminated by working in a host language with reflection capabilities: we start from a shallow embedding that can use all libraries and tools of the host language, and later use reflection to expose the deep structure of the embedded programs. Concretely, we apply this technique to embed three programming languages -- Kaleidoscope, SaC, and (a subset of) APL -- into the dependently typed theorem prover Agda, using dependent types to statically enforce several properties of interest. We then use Agda's reflection capabilities to extract the embedded programs back into the original language, so that the existing toolchain can be leveraged. In this process, statically verified properties of the host language are mapped onto runtime checks in the target language, allowing extracted programs to interact safely with existing code. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with the implementation and extraction of a convolutional neural network in our embedding of APL.{\textbackslash}@},

  abstract = {Bit-vectors, which are integers in a finite number of bits, are ubiquitous in software and hardware systems. In this work, we consider the satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) of bit-vectors. Unlike normal integers, the arithmetics of bit-vectors are modular upon integer overflow. Therefore, the SMT solving of bit-vectors needs to resolve the underlying modular arithmetics. In the literature, two prominent approaches for SMT solving are bit-blasting (that transforms the SMT problem into boolean satisfiability) and integer solving (that transforms the SMT problem into integer properties). Both approaches ignore the algebraic properties of the modular arithmetics and hence could not utilize these properties to improve the efficiency of SMT solving. In this work, we consider the equational theory of bit-vectors and capture the algebraic properties behind them via strong Gr{\textbackslash}"obner bases. First, we apply strong Gr{\textbackslash}"obner bases to the quantifier-free equational theory of bit-vectors and propose a novel algorithmic improvement in the key computation of multiplicative inverse modulo a power of two. Second, we resolve the important case of invariant generation in quantified equational bit-vector properties via strong Gr{\textbackslash}"obner bases and linear congruence solving. Experimental results over an extensive range of benchmarks show that our approach outperforms existing methods in both time efficiency and memory consumption.},

Existing LLM-based provers try to prove theorems in a fully autonomous mode without human intervention. In this mode, they struggle with novel and challenging theorems, for which human insights may be critical. In this paper, we explore LLMs as copilots that assist humans in proving theorems. We introduce Lean Copilot, a framework for running LLM inference in Lean. It enables programmers to build various LLM-based proof automation tools that integrate seamlessly into the workflow of Lean users. Using Lean Copilot, we build tools for suggesting proof steps (tactic suggestion), completing intermediate proof goals (proof search), and selecting relevant premises (premise selection) using LLMs. Users can use our pretrained models or bring their own ones that run either locally (with or without GPUs) or on the cloud. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in assisting humans and automating theorem proving process compared to existing rule-based proof automation in Lean.

  abstract = {Coq is built around a well-delimited kernel that performs type checking for definitions in a variant of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC). Although the metatheory of CIC is very stable and reliable, the correctness of its implementation in Coq is less clear. Indeed, implementing an efficient type checker for CIC is a rather complex task, and many parts of the code rely on implicit invariants which can easily be broken by further evolution of the code. Therefore, on average, one critical bug has been found every year in Coq. This paper presents the first implementation of a type checker for the kernel of Coq (without the module system, template polymorphism and {$H$}-conversion), which is proven sound and complete in Coq with respect to its formal specification. Note that because of G{\"o}del's second incompleteness theorem, there is no hope to prove completely the soundness of the specification of Coq inside Coq (in particular strong normalization), but it is possible to prove the correctness and completeness of the implementation assuming soundness of the specification, thus moving from a trusted code base (TCB) to a trusted theory base (TTB) paradigm. Our work is based on the MetaCoq project which provides meta-programming facilities to work with terms and declarations at the level of the kernel. We verify a relatively efficient type checker based on the specification of the typing relation of the Polymorphic, Cumulative Calculus of Inductive Constructions (PCUIC) at the basis of Coq. It is worth mentioning that during the verification process, we have found a source of incompleteness in Coq's official type checker, which has then been fixed in Coq 8.14 thanks to our work. In addition to the kernel implementation, another essential feature of Coq is the so-called extraction mechanism: the production of executable code in functional languages from Coq definitions. We present a verified version of this subtle type and proof erasure step, therefore enabling the verified extraction of a safe type checker for Coq in the future.

However, both systems are limited by second-class implementations of these constructs, and these limitations are only overcomed by ad-hoc extensions to the respective systems. We propose an embedding of type classes into a dependent type theory that is first-class and supports some of the most popular extensions right away. The implementation is correspondingly cheap, general and integrates well inside the system, as we have experimented in Coq. We show how it can be used to help structured programming and proving by way of examples.},

  abstract = {Proof assistants are getting more widespread use in research and industry to provide certified and independently checkable guarantees about theories, designs, systems and implementations. However, proof assistant implementations themselves are seldom verified, although they take a major share of the trusted code base in any such certification effort. In this area, proof assistants based on Higher-Order Logic enjoy stronger guarantees, as self-certified implementations have been available for some years. One cause of this difference is the inherent complexity of dependent type theories together with their extensions with inductive types, universe polymorphism and complex sort systems, and the gap between theory on paper and practical implementations in efficient programming languages. MetaCoq is a collaborative project that aims to tackle these difficulties to provide the first fully-certified realistic implementation of a type checker for the full calculus underlying the Coq proof assistant. To achieve this, we refined the sometimes blurry, if not incorrect, specification and implementation of the system. We show how theoretical tools from this community such as bidirectional type-checking, Tait-Martin-L{\textbackslash}"of/Takahashi's confluence proof technique and monadic and dependently-typed programming can help construct the following artefacts: a specification of Coq's syntax and type theory, the Polymorphic Cumulative Calculus of (Co)-Inductive Constructions (PCUIC); a monad for the manipulation of raw syntax and interaction with the Coq system; a verification of PCUIC's metatheory, whose main results are the confluence of reduction, type preservation and principality of typing; a realistic, correct and complete type-checker for PCUIC; a sound type and proof erasure procedure from PCUIC to untyped lambda-calculus, i.e., the core of the extraction mechanism of Coq.},

Yet binders, substitutions, and instantiation of terms with substitutions are a critical ingredient of many programming languages. Any practicable mechanisation of the meta-theory of the latter hence requires a lean formalisation of the former. We investigate the topic from three angles: First, we realise formal systems with binders based on both pure and scoped de Bruijn algebras together with basic syntactic rewriting lemmas and automation. We automate this process in a compiler called Autosubst; our final tool supports many-sorted, variadic, and modular syntax. Second, we justify our choice of realisation and mechanise a proof of convergence of the sigma calculus, a calculus of explicit substitutions that is complete for equality of the de Bruijn algebra corresponding to the lambda calculus. Third, to demonstrate the practical usefulness of our approach, we provide concise, transparent, and accessible mechanised proofs for a variety of case studies refined to de Bruijn substitutions.},

Many of our results specify executable algorithms that work on infinite inputs by means of operating on finite approximations and are proven correct in the sense of computable analysis. The development is done in the proof assistant Coq and heavily relies on the Incone library for information theoretic continuity. This library is developed by one of the authors and the paper can be used as an introduction to the library as it describes many of its most important features in detail. While the ability to have full executability in a formal development of mathematical statements about real numbers and the like is not a feature that is unique to the Incone library, its original contribution is to adhere to the conventions of computable analysis to provide a general purpose interface for algorithmic reasoning on continuous structures. The results that provide complete computational content include that the algebraic operations and the efficient limit operator on the reals are computable, that certain countably infinite products are isomorphic to spaces of functions, compatibility of the enumeration representation of subsets of natural numbers with the abstract definition of the space of open subsets of the natural numbers, and that continuous realizability implies sequential continuity. We also formalize proofs of non-computational results that support the correctness of our definitions. These include that the information theoretic notion of continuity used in the library is equivalent to the metric notion of continuity on Baire space, a complete comparison of the different concepts of continuity that arise from metric and represented-space structures and the discontinuity of the unrestricted limit operator on the real numbers and the task of selecting an element of a closed subset of the natural numbers.},

  abstract = {MergeInsertion, also known as the Ford-Johnson algorithm, is a sorting algorithm which, up to today, for many input sizes achieves the best known upper bound on the number of comparisons. Indeed, it gets extremely close to the information-theoretic lower bound. While the worst-case behavior is well understood, only little is known about the average case. This work takes a closer look at the average case behavior. In particular, we establish an upper bound of \$n {\textbackslash}log n - 1.4005n + o(n)\$ comparisons. We also give an exact description of the probability distribution of the length of the chain a given element is inserted into and use it to approximate the average number of comparisons numerically. Moreover, we compute the exact average number of comparisons for \$n\$ up to 148. Furthermore, we experimentally explore the impact of different decision trees for binary insertion. To conclude, we conduct experiments showing that a slightly different insertion order leads to a better average case and we compare the algorithm to the recent combination with (1,2)-Insertionsort by Iwama and Teruyama.}

FM aim to provide sound and understandable reasoning about problems in computer science, which seemingly collides with the black-box nature that inhibits many AI approaches. However, many researchers have crossed this gap and applied AI techniques to enhance FM approaches. As this dichotomy of FM and AI sparked our interest, we conducted a systematic mapping study to map the current landscape of research publications. In this study, we investigate the previous five years of applied AI to FM (2019-2023), as these correspond to periods of high activity. This investigation results in 189 entries, which we explore in more detail to find current trends, highlight research gaps, and give suggestions for future research.},

Recently, we introduced a polynomial checking method whose most expensive steps recall the comparisons done with multiset path orderings. We describe the implementation of our method in the Cyclist prover. Referred to as E-Cyclist, it successfully checked all the proofs included in the original distribution of Cyclist. Heuristics have been devised to automatically define from the analysis of the proof derivations the ordering measures that satisfy the ordering constraints. FOLID cyclic proof derivations may also be hard to certify. E-Cyclist witnesses a strong relation between the two cyclic and well-founded induction reasonings. This opens the perspective of using the known certification methods that work for well-founded induction proofs.},

From a theoretical point of view, every structural proof can be converted to a cyclic proof but the other way is only conjectured. From a practical point of view, i) structural induction principles are built-in or automatically issued from the analysis of recursive data structures by many theorem provers, and ii) the implementation of cyclic induction reasoning may require additional resources such as functional schemas, libraries and human interaction. In this paper, we firstly define a set of conjectures that can be proved by using cyclic induction and following a similar scenario. Next, we implement the cyclic induction reasoning in the Coq proof assistant. Finally, we show that the scenarios for proving these conjectures with structural induction differ in terms of the number of induction steps and lemmas, as well as proof scenario. We identified three conjectures from this set that are hard or impossible to be proved by structural induction.},

A concise realizability semantics is presented for these types. The paper shows how a number of constructions of traditional interest in type theory are possible in RelTT, including eta-laws for basic types, inductive types with their induction principles, and positive-recursive types. A crucial role is played by a lemma called Identity Inclusion, which refines the Identity Extension property familiar from the semantics of parametric polymorphism. The paper concludes with a type system for RelTT, paving the way for implementation.},

Solutions to this problem, applied to Drosophila chromosomes, were computed by hand. The first algorithmic result was a heuristic that was published in 1982. In the 1990s a more biologically relevant version of the problem, where the elements have signs that are also inverted by a reversal, finally received serious attention by the computer science community. This effort eventually resulted in the first polynomial time algorithm for Signed Sorting by Reversals. Since then, a dozen more articles have been dedicated to simplifying the theory and developing algorithms with improved running times. The current best algorithm, which runs in \$O(n {\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}2 n / {\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}log n)\$ time, fails to meet what some consider to be the likely lower bound of \$O(n {\textbackslash}log n)\$. In this article, we present the first algorithm that runs in \$O(n {\textbackslash}log n)\$ time in the worst case. The algorithm is fairly simple to implement, and the running time hides very low constants.},

  abstract = {Reasoning modulo equivalences is natural for everyone, including mathematicians. Unfortunately, in proof assistants based on type theory, equality is appallingly syntactic and, as a result, exploiting equivalences is cumbersome at best. Parametricity and univalence are two major concepts that have been explored to transport programs and proofs across type equivalences, but they fall short of achieving seamless, automatic transport. This work first clarifies the limitations of these two concepts in isolation, and then devises a fruitful marriage between both. The resulting concept, univalent parametricity, is an heterogeneous extension of parametricity strengthened with univalence that fully realizes programming and proving modulo equivalences. In addition to the theory of univalent parametricity, we present a lightweight framework implemented in Coq that allows the user to transparently transfer definitions and theorems for a type to an equivalent one, as if they were equal. For instance, this makes it possible to conveniently switch between an easy-to-reason-about representation and a computationally-efficient representation, as soon as they are proven equivalent. The combination of parametricity and univalence supports transport {\textbackslash}`a la carte: basic univalent transport, which stems from a type equivalence, can be complemented with additional proofs of equivalences between functions over these types, in order to be able to lift more programs and proofs, as well as to yield more efficient terms. We illustrate the use of univalent parametricity on several examples, including a recent integration of native integers in Coq.},

We start by filtering for linearity the proof terms associated by our Prolog-based theorem prover for Implicational Intuitionistic Logic. This works, but using for each formula a PSPACE-complete algorithm limits it to very small formulas. We take a few walks back and forth over the bridge between proof terms and theorems, provided by the Curry-Howard isomorphism, and derive step-by-step an efficient algorithm requiring a low polynomial effort per generated theorem. The resulting Prolog program runs in O(N) space for terms of size N and generates in a few hours 7,566,084,686 theorems in the implicational fragment of Linear Intuitionistic Logic together with their proof terms in normal form. As applications, we generate datasets for correctness and scalability testing of linear logic theorem provers and training data for neural networks working on theorem proving challenges. The results in the paper, organized as a literate Prolog program, are fully replicable.

  abstract = {Coq is a formal proof management system. It provides a formal language to write mathematical definitions, executable algorithms and theorems together with an environment for semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs. Typical applications include the certification of properties of programming languages (e.g. the CompCert compiler certification project, the Verified Software Toolchain for verification of C programs, or the Iris framework for concurrent separation logic), the formalization of mathematics (e.g. the full formalization of the Feit-Thompson theorem, or homotopy type theory), and teaching. Coq version 8.14 integrates many usability improvements, as well as an important change in the core language. The main changes include: The internal representation of {$<$}code{$>$}match{$<$}/code{$>$} has changed to a more space-efficient and cleaner structure, allowing the fix of a completeness issue with cumulative inductive types in the type-checker. The internal representation is now closer to the user-level view of {$<$}code{$>$}match{$<$}/code{$>$}, where the argument context of branches and the inductive binders {$<$}code{$>$}in{$<$}/code{$>$} and {$<$}code{$>$}as{$<$}/code{$>$} do not carry type annotations. A new {$<$}code{$>$}coqnative{$<$}/code{$>$} binary performs separate native compilation of libraries, starting from a {$<$}code{$>$}.vo{$<$}/code{$>$} file. It is supported by {$<$}code{$>$}coq\_makefile{$<$}/code{$>$}. Improvements to typeclasses and canonical structure resolution, allowing more terms to be considered as classes or keys. More control over notations declarations and support for primitive types in string and number notations. Removal of deprecated tactics, notably {$<$}code{$>$}omega{$<$}/code{$>$}, which has been replaced by a greatly improved {$<$}code{$>$}lia{$<$}/code{$>$}, along with many bug fixes. New Ltac2 APIs for interaction with Ltac1, manipulation of inductive types and printing. Many changes and additions to the standard library in the numbers, vectors and lists libraries. A new signed primitive integers library {$<$}code{$>$}Sint63{$<$}/code{$>$} is available in addition to the unsigned {$<$}code{$>$}Uint63{$<$}/code{$>$} library. See the Changes in 8.14.0 section below for the detailed list of changes, including potentially breaking changes marked with {$<$}strong{$>$}Changed{$<$}/strong{$>$}. Coq's reference manual, documentation of the standard library and developer documentation of the ML API are also available. Emilio Jes{\'u}s Gallego Arias, Ga{\"e}tan Gilbert, Michael Soegtrop and Th{\'e}o Zimmermann worked on maintaining and improving the continuous integration system and package building infrastructure. Erik Martin-Dorel has maintained the Coq Docker images that are used in many Coq projects for continuous integration.

Coq version 8.19 extends the kernel universe polymorphism to polymorphism over sorts (e.g. Prop, SProp) along with a few new features, a host of improvements to the notation system, the Ltac2 standard library, and the removal of some standard library files after a long deprecation period. We highlight some of the most impactful changes here: Sort polymorphism makes it possible to share common constructs over Type Prop and SProp. The notation term\%\_scope to set a scope only temporarily (in addition to term\%scope for opening a scope applying to all subterms). lazy, simpl, cbn and cbv and the associated Eval and eval reductions learned to do head reduction when given flag head. New Ltac2 APIs, improved Ltac2 exact and dynamic building of Ltac2 term patterns. New performance evaluation facilities: Instructions to count CPU instructions used by a command (Linux only) and Profiling system to produce trace files. New command Attributes to assign attributes such as deprecated to a library file. Notable breaking changes: replace with by tac does not automatically attempt to solve the generated equality subgoal using the hypotheses. Use by first [assumption {\textbar} symmetry;assumption {\textbar} tac] if you need the previous behaviour. Removed old deprecated files from the standard library. See the Changes in 8.19.0 section below for the detailed list of changes, including potentially breaking changes marked with Changed.

The rule Ex Falso Quodlibet induces spectacular irrelevance. We therefore drop it. The resulting systems of Core Logic C and Classical Core Logic C+ can formalize all the informally rigorous reasoning in constructive and classical mathematics respectively. We effect a revised match-up between deducibility in Classical Core Logic and a new notion of relevant logical consequence. It matches better the deducibility relation of Classical Core Logic than does the Tarskian notion of consequence. It is implosive, not explosive.},

  abstract = {Proof-theoretic semantics is here presented as primarily concerned with the investigation of the relationship between proofs (understood as abstract entities) and derivations (the linguistic representations of proofs). This relationship is taken to be analogous to that between names and (abstract) objects in Frege. On this conception of proof-theoretic semantics, reductions and expansions should be viewed as identity-preserving operations on derivations and thus as inducing an equivalence relation on derivations such that equivalent derivations denote the same proof. Using this equivalence on derivations it is possible to define an equivalence relation on formulas that is stricter than interderivability, called isomorphism. We argue that identity of proofs and formula isomorphism show the intensional nature of this conception of proof-theoretic semantics. Finally, this conception is compared to the one advocated by Dummett and Prawitz, which is based on a notion of validity of derivations.},

  abstract = {Developing a suggestion by Russell, Prawitz showed how the usual natural deduction inference rules for disjunction, conjunction and absurdity can be derived using those for implication and the second order quantifier in propositional intuitionistic second order logic \$NI{\textasciicircum}2\$. It is however well known that the translation does not preserve the relations of identity among derivations induced by the permutative conversions and immediate expansions for the definable connectives, at least when the equational theory of \$NI{\textasciicircum}2\$ is assumed to consist only of {$\beta$} and {$\eta$} equations. On the basis of the categorial interpretation of \$NI{\textasciicircum}2\$, we introduce a new class of equations expressing what in categorial terms is a naturality condition satisfied by the transformations interpreting \$NI{\textasciicircum}2\$-derivations. We show that the Russell-Prawitz translation does preserve identity of proof with respect to the enriched system by highlighting the fact that naturality corresponds to a generalized permutation principle. We show that these result generalize some facts which have gone so far unnoticed, namely that the Russell-Prawitz translation maps particular classes of instances of the equations governing disjunction (and the other definable connectives) onto equations which are already included in the \${\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}eta\$ equational theory of \$NI{\textasciicircum}2\$. Finally, we compare our approach with the one proposed by Ferreira and Ferreira and show that the naturality condition suggests a generalization of their methods to a wider class of formulas.},

Recently, Brown and Rizkallah extended this translation to higher-order logic, but did not prove the classical equivalence, and showed that the embedding fails in the presence of functional extensionality. We prove that functional extensionality and propositional extensionality are sufficient to derive the classical equivalence between a higher-order formula and its translation. We emphasize a condition under which Kuroda's translation works with functional extensionality.},

When inductive definitions involve binders, then Barendregt's variable convention is nearly always employed (explicitly or implicitly) in order to obtain simple proofs. Using this convention, one does not consider truly arbitrary bound names, as required by the rule induction principle, but rather bound names about which various freshness assumptions are made. Unfortunately, neither Barendregt nor others give a formal justification for the variable convention, which makes it hard to formalise such proofs. In this paper we identify conditions an inductive definition has to satisfy so that a form of the variable convention can be built into the rule induction principle. In practice this means we come quite close to the informal reasoning of ``pencil-and-paper'' proofs, while remaining completely formal. Our conditions also reveal circumstances in which Barendregt's variable convention is not applicable, and can even lead to faulty reasoning.},

It provides a proving infrastructure for reasoning about programming language calculi involving named bound variables (as opposed to de-Bruijn indices). In this paper we present an extension of Nominal Isabelle for dealing with general bindings, that means term constructors where multiple variables are bound at once. Such general bindings are ubiquitous in programming language research and only very poorly supported with single binders, such as lambda-abstractions. Our extension includes new definitions of alpha-equivalence and establishes automatically the reasoning infrastructure for alpha-equated terms. We also prove strong induction principles that have the usual variable convention already built in.},

A computation occurs by transforming an expression into another using such rules.

The study of complexity analysis focuses on the development of automatable techniques to provide bounds to this number. In this paper, we consider a form of higher-order rewriting with a call-by-value evaluation strategy, so as to model call-by-value programs.

  title = {A {{Review}} of {{Three Techniques}} for {{Formally Representing Variable Binding}}},
  author = {Vaughan, Jeffrey A},
  abstract = {This paper compares three models for formal reasoning about programming languages with binding. Higher order abstract syntax (hoas) uses meta-level binding to represent object-level binding [PE88]. Nominal Logic couples a concrete representation of bound variables with a formal apparatus for safely manipulating bound variables [Pit03]. The locally named binding representation places bound and free variables in different syntactic sorts [MP99]. This paper surveys each binding model, and compares it to the others and to Gordon and Melham's axiomatization of the untyped lambda calculus [GM97]. Comparisons are made based on expressive power, transparency to human readers, and suitability for mechanized reasoning of each binding model. Each system excels in one area; hoas is most expressive, Nominal Logic most transparent, and locally named most mechanizable.},

To cover the latter, he developed classical sequent calculus and proved a corresponding theorem, the famous cut elimination result. Its proof was organized so that a cut elimination result for an intuitionistic sequent calculus came out as a special case, namely the one in which the sequents have at most one formula in the right, succedent part. Thus, there was no need for a direct proof of normalization for intuitionistic natural deduction. The only traces of such a proof in the published thesis are some convertibilities, such as when an implication introduction is followed by an implication elimination [1934--35, II.5.13]. It remained to Dag Prawitz in 1965 to work out a proof of normalization. Another, less known proof was given also in 1965 by Andres Raggio.                                         We found in February 2005 an early handwritten version of Gentzen's thesis, with exactly the above title, but with rather different contents: Most remarkably, it contains a detailed proof of normalization for what became the standard system of natural deduction. The manuscript is located in the Paul Bernays collection at the ETH-Zurichwith the signum               Hs               . 974: 271. Bernays must have gotten it well before the time of his being expelled from G{\"o}ttingen on the basis of the racial laws in April 1933.},

We show that all these differently flavoured categories of nominal sets are monadic over supported sets. Thus, supported sets provide a canonical finite way to represent nominal sets and the automata therein, e.g. register automata. Name binding in supported sets is modelled by a functor following the idea of de Bruijn indices. This functor lifts to the well-known abstraction functor in nominal sets. Together with the monadicity result, this gives rise to a determinization process that takes the finite representation of a register automaton in supported sets and transforms it into its configuration automaton in nominal sets.},

  abstract = {Interaction trees (ITrees) are a general-purpose data structure for representing the behaviors of recursive programs that interact with their environments. A coinductive variant of ``free monads,'' ITrees are built out of uninterpreted events and their continuations. They support compositional construction of interpreters from event handlers, which give meaning to events by defining their semantics as monadic actions. ITrees are expressive enough to represent impure and potentially nonterminating, mutually recursive computations, while admitting a rich equational theory of equivalence up to weak bisimulation. In contrast to other approaches such as relationally specified operational semantics, ITrees are executable via code extraction, making them suitable for debugging, testing, and implementing software artifacts that are amenable to formal verification. We have implemented ITrees and their associated theory as a Coq library, mechanizing classic domain- and category-theoretic results about program semantics, iteration, monadic structures, and equational reasoning. Although the internals of the library rely heavily on coinductive proofs, the interface hides these details so that clients can use and reason about ITrees without explicit use of Coq's coinduction tactics. To showcase the utility of our theory, we prove the termination-sensitive correctness of a compiler from a simple imperative source language to an assembly-like target whose meanings are given in an ITree-based denotational semantics. Unlike previous results using operational techniques, our bisimulation proof follows straightforwardly by structural induction and elementary rewriting via an equational theory of combinators for control-flow graphs.},

  abstract = {Parameterized systems play a crucial role in the computer field, and their security is of great significance. Formal verification of parameterized protocols is especially challenging due to its "parameterized" feature, which brings complexity and undecidability. Existing automated parameterized verification methods have limitations, such as facing difficulties in automatically deriving parameterized invariants constrained by mixed Forall and Exists quantifiers, or having challenges in completing the parameterized verification of large and complex protocols. This paper proposes a formal verification framework for parameterized systems based on induction, named wiseParaverifier. It starts from small concretizations of protocols, analyzes inductive counterexamples, and constructs counterexample formulas to guide the entire process of parameterized verification. It also presents a heuristic Generalize method to quickly find auxiliary invariants, a method for promoting complex mixed quantifiers and merging parameterized invariants, and uses symmetric reduction ideas to accelerate the verification process. Experimental results show that wiseParaverifier can successfully complete automatic inductive verification on 7 cache coherence protocols and 10 distributed protocols. It has strong verification capabilities and migration capabilities, and can provide concise and readable verification results, which is helpful for learners to understand protocol behaviors.},

As the main theorem of the work, it has been shown that the game-semantic model may execute all the computation of the programming language PCF. The present paper revisits this result from an automata-theoretic perspective: It shows that deterministic non-erasing pushdown automata whose input tape is equipped with simple directed edges between cells can implement all the game-semantic PCF-computation, where the edges rather restrict the cells of the tape which the automata may read off. This is a mathematically highly-surprising phenomenon because it is well-known that the more powerful non-deterministic erasing pushdown automata are strictly weaker than Turing machines (in the Chomsky hierarchy), let alone than PCF.},

Specifically, following the historic groupoid interpretation by Hofmann and Streicher, we equip predicative games in Part I with a groupoid structure, which gives rise to the notion of (predicative) gamoids. Roughly, gamoids are "games with (computational) equalities specified", which interpret subtleties in Id-types. We then formulate a category with families of predicative gamoids, equipped with dependent product, dependent sum, and Id-types as well as universes, which forms a concrete instance of the groupoid model.

Our motivations are to reduce various logics into a single one, clarify the dichotomy between linearity and non-linearity (resp. intuitionisity and classicality) in logic, and further prove that actually we do not need polarities for the unity of logic. Our starting conjecture is that there would be mathematically precise operations of unlinearization and classicalization on logic such that the unlinearization of classical linear logic (CLL) (resp. intuitionistic linear logic (ILL\vphantom\{\}) coincides with classical logic (CL) (resp. intuitionistic logic (IL)), and the classicalization of IL (resp. ILL) with CL (resp. CLL), where the two operations are compatible in the sense of the evident commutativity. Nevertheless, CLL, in contradiction to the name, is actually not the classicalization of ILL, and CL is not the unlinearization of CLL, both of which are obvious from a game-semantic analysis. The main contribution of the present work is then to prove the conjecture in terms of sequent calculi except that CLL is replaced with its negative fragment, which let us call classical linear logic negative (CLLN).},

Such a sequent calculus gives rise to a multi-conclusion natural deduction system and to a version of Parigot's free deduction. The elimination rules are ``general,'' but can be systematically simplified. Cut-elimination and normalization hold. Restriction to a single formula in the succedent yields intuitionistic versions of these systems. The rules also yield generalized lambda calculi providing proof terms for natural deduction proofs as in the Curry--Howard isomorphism. Addition of an indirect proof rule yields classical single-conclusion versions of these systems. Gentzen's standard systems arise as special cases.},

  abstract = {Logic has pride of place in mathematics and its 20th century offshoot, computer science. Modern symbolic logic was developed, in part, as a way to provide a formal framework for mathematics: Frege, Peano, Whitehead and Russell, as well as Hilbert developed systems of logic to formalize mathematics. These systems were meant to serve either as themselves foundational, or at least as formal analogs of mathematical reasoning amenable to mathematical study, e.g., in Hilbert's consistency program. Similar efforts continue, but have been expanded by the development of sophisticated methods to study the properties of such systems using proof and model theory. In parallel with this evolution of logical formalisms as tools for articulating mathematical theories (broadly speaking), much progress has been made in the quest for a mechanization of logical inference and the investigation of its theoretical limits, culminating recently in the development of new foundational frameworks for mathematics with sophisticated computer-assisted proof systems. In addition, logical formalisms developed by logicians in mathematical and philosophical contexts have proved immensely useful in describing theories and systems of interest to computer scientists, and to some degree, vice versa. Three examples of the influence of logic in computer science are automated reasoning, computer verification, and type systems for programming languages.},

We describe one linear and one affine type systems and we formulate abstract categorical models for both of them which are sound and computationally adequate. We also show, under basic assumptions, that interpreting lambda abstractions via a monoidal closed structure (a popular method for linear type systems) necessarily leads to degenerate and inadequate models for call-by-value affine type systems with recursion. In our categorical treatment, a solution to this problem is clearly presented. Our categorical models are more general than linear/non-linear models used to study linear logic and we present a homogeneous categorical account of both linear and affine type systems in a call-by-value setting. We also give examples with many concrete models, including classical and quantum ones.},

As one result we characterize generalized braid monoids represented by undirected graphs, being a subclass of Artin--Tits monoids. Stated in other words, we investigate to which graphs the old Garside result stating that braid monoids have the property of common right multiples, generalizes. This characterization also follows from old results on Coxeter groups and the connection between finiteness of Coxeter groups and common right multiples in Artin--Tits monoids. However, our independent presentation is self-contained up to some basic knowledge of rewriting, and also applies to monoids beyond the Artin--Tits format. The main new contribution is a technique to prove that the property of common right multiples does not hold, by finding a particular model, in our examples all being finite.},

We follow Grothendieck's functor of points approach, which defines schemes, the quintessential notion of modern algebraic geometry, as certain well-behaved functors from commutative rings to sets. This approach is often regarded as conceptually simpler than the standard approach of defining schemes as locally ringed spaces, but to our knowledge it has not yet been adopted in formalizations of algebraic geometry. We build upon a previous formalization of the so-called Zariski lattice associated to a commutative ring in order to define the notion of compact open subfunctor. This allows for a concise definition of qcqs-schemes, streamlining the usual presentation as e.g. given in the standard textbook of Demazure and Gabriel. It also lets us obtain a fully constructive proof that compact open subfunctors of affine schemes are qcqs-schemes.},

@article{zhangEquivalenceCountableComputable,
  title = {Equivalence of {{Countable}} and {{Computable}}},
  author = {Zhang, Hantao},
  abstract = {The concept of ``countable set'' is attributed to Georg Cantor, who set the boundary between countable and uncountable sets in 1874. The concept of ``computable set'' arose in the study of computing models in the 1930s by the founders of computer science, including G{\textasciidieresis}odel, Church, and Turing. However, the connection between countability and computability was not thoroughly studied in the past eight decades. A counting bijection of a set S is a bijection from the set of natural numbers to S. We say S is enumerable if either S is finite or S has a computable counting bijection. S is countable if S is enumerable. We prove that S is enumerable if and only if S is computable. This equivalence provides insights to the study of set theory and computability theory and reveals that countability is related to space and time complexity. We show that the set of total computable functions (or deciders, algorithms) is unenumerable. We also provide a sufficient and necessary condition for a set to be enumerable and use the concept of counting order to explain why some sets are unenumerable. We show that some popular statements about countable sets, such as ``every subset of a countable set is countable'' or ``every formal language is countable,'' lack a valid proof. These unproven statements are widely taught in college courses on discrete mathematics, set theory, and computability theory.},

In the end, we list some mistakes made in the early versions of this introduction. The interpretation of common type formers in dependent type theories are discussed based on existing categorical constructions instead of mechanically derived from their type theoretical definition. Non-dependent type formers include unit, products (as fiber products), and functions (as fiber exponents), and dependent ones include extensional equalities (as equalizers), dependent products, and the universe of (all) propositions (as the subobject classifier).},
